As you tap around from app to app, you’ll see that there’s no standard way to refer to the things that belong to you within an interface. Some say it’s my stuff. Some say it’s your stuff.

Today, after discussions with publishers and technology companies around the world, we’re announcing a new open source initiative called Accelerated Mobile Pages, which aims to dramatically improve the performance of the mobile web. We want webpages with rich content like video, animations and graphics to work alongside smart ads, and to load instantaneously.

## ToRead List
* [moq/moq4](https://github.com/moq/moq4) - Moq (pronounced "Mock-you" or just "Mock") is the only mocking library for .NET developed from scratch to take full advantage of .NET Linq expression trees and lambda expressions, which makes it the most productive, type-safe and refactoring-friendly mocking library available.

## Android to REST
* [Android Login and Registration with PHP, MySQL and SQLite](http://www.androidhive.info/2012/01/android-login-and-registration-with-php-mysql-and-sqlite/) (Jan 31, 2012) - In this tutorial I am going to explain how to build complete login and registration system in android using PHP, MySQL and SQLite.

As this tutorial seems lengthy, I had divided it into 2 parts. In the 1st part we learn fundamental concepts of REST and do the required setup. In the 2nd part building actual API (writing PHP & MySQL code) is covered.


## REST Api Architecture
* [The Importance of Serializing API Output](https://philsturgeon.uk/api/2015/05/30/serializing-api-output/) (May 30 2015) - when I talk about serialization, which I refer to as "adding a presentation layer to your data".
* [Building a Decent API](https://philsturgeon.uk/api/2013/07/12/building-a-decent-api/) (Jul 12 2013) - PHP developers are increasingly moving over to API development, as are a lot of server-side developers. It's a trend that's been happening for the last few years and it's getting to the point where everyone and their dog are putting articles showing off how to build "awesome" API's. Unfortunately most of these are either woefully inadequate or are promoting bad practices. I'm not going to link to any bad examples because that's just rude, but here are some golden rules that I stick to when building out API's.
* [HTTP API Design Guide](https://github.com/interagent/http-api-design) (Jul 5, 2016) - HTTP API design guide extracted from work on the [Heroku Platform API](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-reference).
* [The Web API checklist - 43 things to think about](https://mathieu.fenniak.net/the-api-checklist/) (Apr 15, 2014)  
When you’re designing, testing, or releasing a new Web API, you’re building a new system on top of an existing complex and sophisticated system. At a minimum, you’re building upon HTTP, which is built upon TCP/IP, which is built upon a series of tubes. You’re also building upon a web server, an application framework, and maybe an API framework.  
Most people, myself included, are not aware of all the intricacies and nuances of every component they’re building upon. Even if you deeply understand each component, it’s probably going to be too much information to hold in your head at one time.
* [Best Practices for Designing a Pragmatic RESTful API](http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api) (Last updated Aug 12, 2015) - Your data model has started to stabilize and you're in a position to create a public API for your web app. You realize it's hard to make significant changes to your API once it's released and want to get as much right as possible up front. Now, the internet has no shortage on opinions on API design. But, since there's no one widely adopted standard that works in all cases, you're left with a bunch of choices: What formats should you accept? How should you authenticate? Should your API be versioned? In designing an API for [Enchant](http://www.enchant.com/) (a [Zendesk Alternative](http://www.enchant.com/zendesk-alternative)), I've tried to come up with pragmatic answers to these questions. My goal is for the [Enchant API](http://dev.enchant.com/api/v1) to be easy to use, easy to adopt and flexible enough to [dogfood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) for our own user interfaces.
* [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) - Swagger is a simple yet powerful representation of your RESTful API. With the largest ecosystem of API tooling on the planet, thousands of developers are supporting Swagger in almost every modern programming language and deployment environment. With a Swagger-enabled API, you get interactive documentation, client SDK generation and discoverability. We created Swagger to help fulfill the promise of APIs. Swagger helps companies like Apigee, Getty Images, Intuit, LivingSocial, McKesson, Microsoft, Morningstar, and PayPal build the best possible services with RESTful APIs. Now in version 2.0, Swagger is more enabling than ever. And it's 100% open source software.
	* [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/) - An editor for designing Swagger specifications from scratch, using a simple YAML structure. [Source](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor)
	* [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) - Turn an API spec into client SDKs or server-side code. You can also generate API client or server using the online generator (https://generator.swagger.io).
* [OAI/OpenAPI-Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) - The goal of The OpenAPI Specification is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, OpenAPI removes the guesswork in calling the service.
