  The PhoneGap Team is proud to announce the release of the [PhoneGap Developer app](http://app.phonegap.com/)!
  The PhoneGap Developer app aims to lower the barrier of entry to creating PhoneGap applications. You can now immediately preview your app on a device without installing platform SDKs, registering devices, or even compiling code.

  I’ve created a [sample mobile application](https://github.com/hollyschinsky/MyAngularPhoneGapProject) to help developers get started building mobile applications with [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) quickly. The sample application includes view navigation, some standard user interface components and code to help avoid common pitfalls in mobile application development (click delays etc).

  It has been six months since I posted the [first version](http://coenraets.org/blog/2014/02/sample-mobile-application-with-ionic-and-angularjs/) of the Employee Directory app built with Ionic and AngularJS. Ionic has been moving fast, and it was time for an update.  
  Employee directory is a sample application that allows you to look up employees by name, view the details of an employee, call, text, or email an employee, and navigate up and down the org chart.
