* [HTML5 vs native: advice for the pragmatic developer](http://www.creativebloq.com/html5/html5-vs-native-advice-pragmatic-developer-10126003) by Freddy May (Oct 26, 2012)  
  There has been an awful lot written on this subject and opinions tend to be black-and-white to grab headlines.

Here are the most important questions to consider when deciding between native and HTML5 app development.

## PhoneGap

  It has been six months since I posted the [first version](http://coenraets.org/blog/2014/02/sample-mobile-application-with-ionic-and-angularjs/) of the Employee Directory app built with Ionic and AngularJS. Ionic has been moving fast, and it was time for an update.
