## Inspiration

### People
* [Dented Reality](http://dentedreality.com.au/) - [Beau Lebens](https://twitter.com/beaulebens)' All of the Things
* [Cities of You](http://citiesofyou.com/)  
  Cities of You is a project that envisions people as imaginary places. Inspired by Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities, I travel through each city and describe their special properties- how the buildings are built, how the people live, its history, culture, and reputation. As the project progresses, I revisit some cities, describing how they evolve over time or enter unexplored parts of the cities. The intended result is to be able to imagine relationships as dynamic spaces in which one can visit, walk through, and explore. -- Brian Foo

  If you haven't seen Philm yet, it is a movie collection and information app that I created for Android. It uses the Trakt and TMDB APIs.  
This morning I pushed the source of Philm to [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisbanes/philm) under the Apache v2.0 licence.  
This does not mean that I have stopped development, it's just got to the point where I'm happy with it so can share the source.  
Philm has been a bit of an experiment as it uses a type of MVC-type architecture to split out UI, business and model code, something that has not really be explored (publicly) in Android development.

With git one can definitely conjure very complicated workflows, I’ve seen them first hand.

A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed of field and value pairs. MongoDB documents are similar to JSON objects. The values of fields may include other documents, arrays, and arrays of documents.

## Startup strategies

* [10 Reasons Why I Self-Funded My Startup and So Should You](http://yongfook.com/10-reasons-why-i-self-funded-my-startup-and-so-should-you.html)  
  This post is simply here to remind some of you why we do what we do. A message that often gets lost,
in this world of funding-hungry startups.  
  8 months ago I started my company. And I never took a cent of outside funding.  
  Here's why I think self-funding (also known as bootstrapping) is the best thing a young startup can do.
* [15 Reasons to Keep Your Company Small](http://readwrite.com/2014/05/05/keep-your-startup-small)  
  Despite all the headlines about billion-dollar exits and IPOs, growing too quickly or too much is not always the most desirable outcome for a startup.  
Fifteen entrepreneurs, members of [Young Entrepreneur Council](http://yec.co/) (YEC), offer their perspective on why, in some cases, smaller means mightier.

  I think I’ve read Paul Graham’s post on “Startup = Growth” three or four times now. And of course on Twitter I’ve seen the Tweets, ReTweets and superlatives on what a great post it is.

## Minimum Viable Stack
Reading [How to build your Minimum Viable Stack](https://medium.com/design-startups/7dcb59c9fe1f) I was thinking about what can be a Minimum Viable Stack for me.
Something similar to what described in this article [Creating a REST Server for a CRUD Web Application from a very Light Stack](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/680119/Creating-a-REST-Server-for-a-CRUD-Web-Application) that is a solution that fits well with my knowledge.
It is based on the following components:

* [NancyFx](http://nancyfx.org/) - Lightweight, low-ceremony, framework for building HTTP based services on .Net and Mono  
  Available as package on [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Nancy/) and as source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy)
* [PetaPoco](http://www.toptensoftware.com/petapoco/) - PetaPoco is a tiny, fast, single-file micro-ORM for .NET and Mono. It works with SQL Server, SQL Server CE, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle. Available as package on [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/packages/PetaPoco) and as source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/toptensoftware/petapoco).
* [System.Data.SQLite](http://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki) - It is an ADO.NET adapter for [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/).  
  Available as package on [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SQLite/).

Some stuff about PetaPoco

* [How to use Dapper & PetaPoco, Micro ORMs](http://stevenhollidge.blogspot.de/2011/04/how-to-use-dapper-petapoco-micro-orms.html) - Dapper (Dynamic Query Mapper) and PetaPoco are Mirco ORMs.  An ORM is an Object Relational Mapper which sit between your business logic and database to abstract away the direct link between the two.  Micro ORMs are a simplier and more efficient option to larger ORM frameworks such as EF4 and NHibernate.
* [.NET Micro-ORMs - Dapper, PetaPoco, and more](http://www.nullskull.com/a/1659/net-microorms--dapper-petapoco-and-more.aspx) - Enter the Micro-ORM. These provide the esssence of what developers want - an easy way to map Database operations to strongly typed classes. LINQ support in some makes it even better. But the main advantage of some of these Micro-ORMs is raw speed. They don't offer all the bells and whistles of the Entity Framework or NHibernate, but in many cases, you don't need all this glop anyway. You simply want to be able to do CRUD and work with objects instead of DataReaders.
* [PetaPoco – Why I’m Using A Micro-ORM](http://schotime.net/blog/index.php/2011/05/04/petapoco-why-im-using-a-micro-orm/) - I had been using my own SQL to Object mapper for a while before I stumbled over PetaPoco, and it had very similar ideas to mine. It has gone one step further though, with nice support for paging, inserts, updates, deletes and multiple database support. 
* [Getting Started PetaPoco: Create POCO and perform CRUD](http://www.emadmokhtar.com/2012/05/getting-started-petapoco-create-poco-and-perform-crud/) by [Emad Mokhtar](http://www.emadmokhtar.com/aboutme) - In this post we’ll learn How to create one POCO and perform CRUD on it, I’ll use the famous Northwind database and create POCO for Customers table, let’s see how we can do it.
* [Get started with ASP.NET MVC and PetaPoco](http://weblogs.asp.net/jalpeshpvadgama/archive/2011/06/17/get-started-with-asp-net-mvc-and-petapoco.aspx) - how  can be used PetaPoco in asp.net mvc application.

## About Retrospective

* Actions following [SMART criteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)
  The November 1981 issue of Management Review contained a paper by George T. Doran called *There's a S.M.A.R.T. way to write management's goals and objectives*. It discussed the importance of objectives and the difficulty in setting them.

  Ideally speaking, each corporate, department, and section objective should be:
  - Specific: target a specific area for improvement.
  - Measurable: quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.
  - Assignable: specify who will do it.
  - Realistic: state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.
  - Time-related: specify when the result(s) can be achieved.

    Notice that these criteria don't say that all objectives must be quantified on all levels of management. In certain situations it is not realistic to attempt quantification, particularly in staff middle-management positions. Practicing managers and corporations can lose the benefit of a more abstract objective in order to gain quantification. It is the combination of the objective and its action plan that is really important. Therefore, serious management should focus on these twins and not just the objective.
