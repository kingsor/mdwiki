## Product Design
* [What Everyone Should Know About The Process Behind App Design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/11/what-everyone-should-know-about-the-process-behind-app-design/) (Nov 7, 2016) - How do you go about designing an app? So, here’s an article about just that. A top level, somewhat simplified, and very honest overview of the steps involved in designing an app. This is an account of how most of the apps I work on are born, complete with shameless links to the tools I use.
* [The Product Design Sprint](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/the-product-design-sprint) (Nov 6, 2013) - A [Product Design Sprint](http://www.gv.com/lib/the-product-design-sprint-a-five-day-recipe-for-startups) (invented by Google Ventures) is a 5-phase exercise which uses design thinking to reduce the inherent risks in successfully bringing products to market. We’ve done many product design sprints and have made them a standard part of our consulting engagements.
* [Product Design](https://www.udacity.com/course/product-design--ud509) @ [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) - There is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come. This course is designed to help you materialize your game-changing idea and transform it into a product that you can build a business around. Product Design blends theory and practice to teach you product validation, UI/UX practices, Google’s Design Sprint and the process for setting and tracking actionable metrics.

## Inspiration
### [Android Mobile Bootcamp at Netflix](http://codepath.com/androidbootcamp)
We are partnering with Netflix to provide our **accelerated 8-week Android evening** bootcamp starting on March 6th. The course was designed to cover all the major topics required to build Android apps according to current industry best practices incorporating the following elements:

* 8-week course, 2 hour sessions 7-9pm on M/W (32 hours)
* Netflix Campus (South Bay), Los Gatos, CA
* Price: No charge
* Weekly 2 hour session to review key mobile concepts and topics.
* Weekly lab session to collaborate on projects and complete coding challenges.
* Weekly app assignments to immediately apply each new topic introduced.
* Group project to design and develop a complete app with a team over the course.

At the end of the program, your group will compete for prizes at Demo Day and you will join our CodePath alumni network which provides access to curated events, opportunities to network with other alums, and priority selection for future classes.

> This is an interesting idea to organize time to learn a topic. Set a goal, and organize time as in a sprint (4/8 weeks) with sessions of 2/3 hours each. May be two or three times a week. Fine tune time and effort. Repeat.

## Mobile UX
* [Hamburger menu alternatives for mobile navigation](https://medium.com/@kollinz/hamburger-menu-alternatives-for-mobile-navigation-a3a3beb555b8) (Nov 3, 2016) by [Zoltan Kollin](https://medium.com/@kollinz) - If you’re working on digital products, you have already read dozens of articles describing how and why the hamburger navigation on mobile (and desktop!) hurts UX metrics due of its [low discoverability](https://medium.com/@kollinz/misused-mobile-ux-patterns-84d2b6930570#6d1e) and efficiency. (You can read some of best articles on the topic [here](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/), [here](https://lmjabreu.com/post/why-and-how-to-avoid-hamburger-menus/), [here](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1945), and [here](http://jamesarcher.me/hamburger-menu).) Luckily, more and more sites and apps are experimenting with alternative, more efficient solutions for this very problem. None of the ideas listed here is better than the others, their viability and performance obviously depend on the content and the context.
* [7 Types of Animations for Your Mobile App](https://dev-yalantis.yalantis.com/blog/-seven-types-of-animations-for-mobile-apps/) (Feb 25, 2016) - You’ve probably heard  the saying  “Good design is obvious and great design is invisible.” The same principle applies to developing animations for mobile apps: a really great animation makes your app user-friendly and catches attention, but it mustn’t distract your user from the app itself. The main task of any animation is to explain the logic of an app to the user. We wanted to share our expert knowledge about designing beautiful and useful animations.
* [5 Design Tricks to Succeed in 2016 for Mobile App Product Owners](https://dev-yalantis.yalantis.com/blog/excellent-mobile-app-design/) (Feb 6, 2016) - What should users do in your app so you can achieve your goals? Why do people that you target would want to use your app? These are two questions our design team usually asks themselves before we start designing an app. We usually expect app design to sell this app’s idea. People buy a product when they want it, not when they need it. As long as we can satisfy the emotional wants of our users, we can deliver a message that we want them to hear. We believe that mobile app design is all about emotion, usability, and communication. Designers call this user experience. These three concepts intertwine in the design of the most successful apps of 2016. And this is where our team heads off on an adventure to design a mobile app. We will guide mobile app product owners in this interesting design journey by teaching them five things they should pay most attention to.
* [How to Create App Design That Works](https://dev-yalantis.yalantis.com/blog/how-to-create-app-design-that-works/) (Mar 16, 2016) - Design is essential to the success of a project. And the process of designing an app involves more than one designer. If an entire team – including business owners – take an active part in the app design process, they can create more beautiful and more useful products. In our complete guide to app design that “works” we will walk you through Yalantis’s approach to designing excellent products.

The Bottom Navigation View has been in the [material design guidelines](https://material.google.com/components/bottom-navigation.html) for some time, but it hasn’t been easy for us to implement it into our apps. Some applications have built their own solutions, whilst others have relied on third-party open-source libraries to get the job done. Now the design support library is seeing the addition of this bottom navigation bar, let’s take a dive into how we can use it! [Sample App on GitHub](https://github.com/hitherejoe/BottomNavigationViewSample)

## Trello Cards

### RecyclerView - Working with
* [Pro RecyclerView](https://realm.io/news/360andev-yigit-boyar-pro-recyclerview-android-ui-java/) (Nov 16, 2016) - In this 360AnDev talk, we will discuss the overall architecture of the RecyclerView: how it works, what are the priorities, and how you can get the most of it. We will also cover some best practices and common pitfalls.
* [Android Working with Recycler View](http://www.androidhive.info/2016/01/android-working-with-recycler-view/) (Jan 21, 2016) - In this tutorial we are going to learn how to render a simple RecyclerView with a custom layout. We’ll also learn writing a adapter class, adding list divider and row click listener. The recycler view we are going to design contains list of movies displaying the title, genre and year of release.
* [alexfu/DividerItemDecoration.java](https://gist.github.com/alexfu/0f464fc3742f134ccd1e) - An ItemDecoration that draws dividers between items. Pulled from Android support demos.
* [A View Divided: Adding Dividers to Your RecyclerView with ItemDecoration](https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/a-view-divided-adding-dividers-to-your-recyclerview-with-itemdecoration/) (Feb 26, 2016) - One common task that isn’t as convenient in RecyclerView is the addition of dividers or offsets between list items, but you can fortunately create your own dividers with ItemDecoration.
* [Using the RecyclerView](https://guides.codepath.com/android/using-the-recyclerview) - The RecyclerView is a new ViewGroup that is prepared to render any adapter-based view in a similar way. It is supposed to be the successor of ListView and GridView, and it can be found in the latest support-v7 version. One of the reasons is that RecyclerView has a more extensible framework, especially since it provides the ability to implement both horizontal and vertical layouts. Use the RecyclerView widget when you have data collections whose elements change at runtime based on user action or network events.
* [Set a click listener to a RecyclerView](http://antonioleiva.com/recyclerview-listener/) (Dec 14, 2015) - If you’ve used a RecyclerView, you may know that they don’t have a `setOnItemClickListener` as `ListView` had, so we have to create our own way to do it. Many people asked me how to do this, so that’s why I decided to write about it. There are many ways to achieve this, but I will show you the way I usually do it. My mechanism consists of passing the listener as a parameter to the constructor and then assign it when I bind the data to the view in `onBindViewHolder`.
* [RecyclerView Part 1: Fundamentals For ListView Experts](https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/recyclerview-part-1-fundamentals-for-listview-experts/) (Dec 5, 2014) - It turns out that RecyclerView is really cool, and worth switching to. It makes a lot of previously hard things much, much, much easier. Most importantly, it makes animating items into and out of a list of content doable in an hour or two, instead of a couple of days.
* [RecyclerView Part 2: Choice Modes](https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/recyclerview-part-2-choice-modes/) (Dec 19, 2014) - When it comes to selecting items in a RecyclerView, though, you are, in fact, on your own: RecyclerView does not give you any tools for doing this. So how do you do it? I figured this would be a straightforward exercise in rolling my own solution, so I dove right in. Here’s what I found out.
* [Expand a RecyclerView in Four Steps](https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/expand-a-recyclerview-in-four-steps/) (Aug 6, 2015) - The Expandable RecyclerView library is a lightweight library that simplifies the inclusion of expandable dropdown rows in your RecyclerView. In it, you have two types of views. The parent view is the one visible by default, and it contains the children. The child view is the one that is expanded or collapsed, and will appear when a parent item is clicked.
* [Android working with Card View and Recycler View](http://www.androidhive.info/2016/05/android-working-with-card-view-and-recycler-view/) (May, 2016) - In this article we are going to learn how to integrate CardView with RecyclerView by creating a beautiful music app that displays music albums with a cover image and title.

* [Android Working with Retrofit HTTP Library](http://www.androidhive.info/2016/05/android-working-with-retrofit-http-library/) (May 8, 2016) by [Android Hive](http://www.androidhive.info/) - this post will show how to use the library Retrofit that is the better alternative to volley in terms of ease of use, performance, extensibility and other things. It is a type-­safe REST client for Android built by Square. As an example, we are going to download some json (using the TMDb Api) and show it in RecyclerView as a list.
* [Best Practices & Pain Points in Mobile Networking: REST API Failure Situations](https://realm.io/news/best-practices-pain-points-mobile-networking-rest-api-failures/) (Sep 30 2016) - Let’s have a look at few of the pain points that come up while talking to your server through a RESTful API.

### RxJava
* [Intro to RxJava](https://realm.io/news/intro-to-rxjava/) (Oct 12 2016) - RxJava is an incredibly powerful tool for making Android code easier to maintain and less bug prone, but as a new Android developer, it might not always be clear what exactly RxJava is doing and why doing things that way helps make code better. In this 360|AnDev talk we’ll discuss how things were traditionally done in Android, problematic areas with these approaches, and how RxJava can help solve some of these issues. In addition to providing the motivation for RxJava, this talk will also provide the audience with examples of the most common RxJava use cases as well as common pitfalls to avoid when integrating RxJava in a project for the first time. No prior Rx knowledge is assumed.
* [Crunching RxAndroid](https://medium.com/crunching-rxandroid) - A step-by-step tutorial about Reactive Programming on Android (7 parties tutorial)
* [Grokking RxJava, Part 1: The Basics](http://blog.danlew.net/2014/09/15/grokking-rxjava-part-1/) (Sep 15, 2014) - RxJava is the new hotness amongst Android developers these days. The only problem is that it can be difficult to approach initially. Functional Reactive Programming is hard when you come from an imperative world, but once you understand it, it's so awesome! I'm here to try to give you a flavor of RxJava. The goal of this four-part series is to get your foot in the door. I'm not going to try to explain everything (nor could I). I just want you to become interested in RxJava and how it works.

* [ConstraintLayout, Inside and Out: Part 1](http://wiresareobsolete.com/2016/07/constraintlayout-part-1/) (Jul 19, 2016) - This post is focused on examining the ConstraintLayout container architecture and how it does its job. The features of the new Android Studio layout editor are primarily designed to make the powerful and flexible features of this container easier for developers to manage. By gaining a deeper understanding of  ConstraintLayout, we will be better equipped to use the developer tools.
* [ConstraintLayout, Inside and Out: Part 2](http://wiresareobsolete.com/2016/07/constraintlayout-part-2/) (July 27, 2016) - In the last post, we spent some time exploring the various constraints that are available for use with ConstraintLayout. Now let’s dive deeper into the mechanics of this flexible new tool, starting with how the code is organized internally.

### Material Design - Working with
* [A Practical Guide to Material Design Implementation for Android Developers](https://realm.io/news/360andev-yash-prabhu-practical-guide-material-design-android-ui/) (Sep 10 2016) - In this 360AnDev talk, you will learn how to: 1) Implement the basics of standard UI elements that are used across most apps like Navigation Drawer, Floating Action Button, Tabs, Grids, CardView, RecyclerView and Coordinator Layout. 2) Use the AppCompat library and Design Support library to implement Material design going all the way back to Android Eclair (2.1). This talk is for Android developers who are interested in utilizing material design principles in their current or upcoming Android apps. The sample code is available on GitHub.
* [Android: An Introduction to Material Design](http://www.raywenderlich.com/103367/material-design) (Jun 22, 2015) - In this tutorial, you’ll integrate material design into an app called Travel Wish List. Along the way, you’ll learn how to: Implement the material theme; Build dynamic views using new widgets like *RecyclerView* and *CardView*; Use Palette API to generate color schemes that you can use for text or background views; Create delightful interactions using the new animation APIs.
* [Android Devs, make your Toolbar and View backgrounds frosty](https://android.jlelse.eu/the-blurry-frosted-background-is-a-common-pattern-on-ios-where-they-have-simply-controls-to-cbd0c5843e5f) (Oct 15, 2016) - The blurry, frosted background is a common pattern on iOS where they have simply controls to achieve this. On Android however, this ends up being a lot of effort. On the up side, if you do bother to handle this yourself, you can achieve better results than you can using the default controls on iOS.

### Android Clean Architectures
* [android-architecture-resources](https://github.com/ziem/android-architecture-resources) - a list of articles, repositories and samples about different android architectures.
* [Difference between MVC and MVP](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1317710) - Martin Fowler has a page on [UI design patterns](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html), in which he defines and then talks about MVC, MVP and other patterns. To summarise the differences, Controllers in the MVC have more control over the UI, and handle events, while a presenter in the MVP is more passive, and just presents information through the UI. In general there's not much difference, and often the line between them is blurry.
* [How to Adopt Model View Presenter on Android](https://code.tutsplus.com/series/how-to-adopt-model-view-presenter-on-android--cms-1012) - In this series, we discuss and emphasize the importance of a well designed project and why Android's standard architecture isn't always sufficient. We explore a few potential problems you may run into while developing Android applications and how to address them by implementing the Model View Presenter (MVP) pattern.
	* [An Introduction to Model View Presenter on Android](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/an-introduction-to-model-view-presenter-on-android--cms-26162) (Mar 30, 2016) - This tutorial should help you understand the importance of a well designed project and why Android's standard architecture isn’t always sufficient. We discuss a few potential problems that you may encounter when developing Android applications and I show you how to address those issues by improving the app's testability and reliability through the Model View Presenter (MVP) pattern.
	* [How to Adopt Model View Presenter on Android](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-adopt-model-view-presenter-on-android--cms-26206) (Apr 8, 2016) - In this tutorial, we explore the Model View Presenter pattern in more detail by implementing it in an Android application.
	* [Testing and Dependency Injection With Model View Presenter on Android](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/testing-and-dependency-injection-with-model-view-presenter-on-android--cms-26164) (Apr 15, 2016) - n this tutorial, we focus on the following topics: 1) setting up the test environment and writing unit tests for the MVP classes; 2) implementing the MVP pattern using dependency injection with Dagger 2; 3) we discuss common problems to avoid when using MVP on Android.

* [Mosby](http://hannesdorfmann.com/mosby/) - Model-View-Presenter library for android. At first glance Mosby looks a lot like a framework. There are some classes like MvpFragment you can extends from, but the point is that you don’t have to if you don’t want to. At it’s core Mosby is a tiny library based on delegation. So you don’t have to use MvpFragment if you don’t want to. You can use delegation and composition to integrate Mosby in your own development stack. Hence you are not caught into a frameworks boundaries and limits.
* [A detailed guide on developing Android apps using the Clean Architecture pattern](https://medium.com/@dmilicic/a-detailed-guide-on-developing-android-apps-using-the-clean-architecture-pattern-d38d71e94029) (Feb 3, 2016) by [Dario Miličić](https://medium.com/@dmilicic) - Ever since I started developing Android apps there was this feeling that it could be done better. I’ve seen a lot of bad software design decisions during my career, some of which were my own  -and Android complexity mixed with bad software design is a recipe for disaster. But it is important to learn from your mistakes and keep improving. After a lot of searching for a better way to develop apps I encountered the Clean Architecture. After applying it to Android, with some refinement and inspiration from similar projects, I decided that this approach is practical enough and worth sharing. The goal of this article is to provide a step-by-step guide for developing Android apps in a Clean way. This whole approach is how I’ve recently been building my apps for clients with great success.

Martin, aka, Uncle Bob](http://cleancoder.com) - Over the last several years we’ve seen a whole range of ideas regarding the architecture of systems. Though these architectures all vary somewhat in their details, they are very similar. They all have the same objective, which is the separation of concerns. They all achieve this separation by dividing the software into layers. Each has at least one layer for business rules, and another for interfaces.
