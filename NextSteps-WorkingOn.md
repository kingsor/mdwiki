## Doing

### AppScale
AppScale is open source Google App Engine and allows you to run your GAE applications on any infrastructure, anywhere that makes sense for your business. AppScale eliminates lock-in and makes your GAE application portable. This way you can choose which public or private cloud platform is the best fit for your business requirements. Because we are literally the GAE alternative, it is an easy migration from Google App Engine to AppScale. AppScale implements the Google App Engine API’s allowing users to move their App Engine applications to AppScale unmodified, while providing the same no-ops experience as Google App Engine. This way you can save time and money by choosing AppScale for your application. Check out our [case studies page](https://www.appscale.com/resources/use-cases/) and see why our customers are so happy.

* [Try AppScale](https://www.appscale.com/try-appscale/) - AppScale can be deployed on a single node (usual case for Dev/Test), and on multiple nodes (production deployments with large datasets or CPU needs). It is possible to try AppScale on Vagrant.

### Design Pattern with CSharp
* [Object Oriented Programming (OOP)](http://www.dotnetcurry.com/software-gardening/1125/object-oriented-programming-oops)

First introduced by Robert “Uncle Bob” Martin, SOLID is not new. Uncle Bob simply took concepts that had been around for years and put them together. However, he didn’t have them in SOLID order. We can credit Michael Feathers for coming up with the SOLID acronym. So, what is SOLID? Well, it is five OOP principles, the first letter of each spelling out SOLID: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. Over the next five issues, I’ll cover each one of these concepts. While originally targeting OOP, many of these concepts apply to non-OOP languages as well.

* [Single Responsibility Principle](http://www.dotnetcurry.com/software-gardening/1148/solid-single-responsibility-principle)
* [Open-Closed Principle](http://www.dotnetcurry.com/software-gardening/1176/solid-open-closed-principle)
* [Liskov Substitution Principle](http://www.dotnetcurry.com/software-gardening/1235/liskov-substitution-principle-lsp-solid-patterns)
* [Interface Segregation Principle](http://www.dotnetcurry.com/software-gardening/1257/interface-segregation-principle-isp-solid-principle)

* [Effective Android Architecture](https://realm.io/news/360andev-richa-khandelwal-effective-android-architecture-patterns-java/) (Sep 21, 2016) by [Richa Khandelwal](https://twitter.com/richa123) - Most engineers start working on apps as prototypes, focusing on functionality until the point the app’s (lack of) architecture becomes an impediment in continuing to build features into the app at a fast pace. This 360AnDev talk will cover experiences with Coursera’s Android app, build up on issues with MVC and go on to illustrate how to start with MVC and get to a solution that fits the apps needs.
* [An Introduction to Model View Presenter on Android](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/an-introduction-to-model-view-presenter-on-android--cms-26162) (Mar 30, 2016) - This tutorial should help you understand the importance of a well designed project and why Android's standard architecture isn’t always sufficient. We discuss a few potential problems that you may encounter when developing Android applications and I show you how to address those issues by improving the app's testability and reliability through the Model View Presenter (MVP) pattern.
* [Android clean architecture part 1](http://luboganev.github.io/blog/clean-architecture-pt1/) (Jul 21, 2015) - At the beginning of the year I have done a whole week of experiments and have put a lot of thought in order to come up with an Android version of the architecture, which our team used while building our iOS application. The main goal was to use the same familiar “architectural language”, which we have developped in our iOS application. This way we do not have to pay too high cost when switching between developing for iOS and Android. We have tried to establish a common language understood by all mobile developers, and I believe that we have succeeded. We have managed to build a pretty complex Android application with a lots of moving parts, which still feels quite right and does not bring us a lot of headaches. I have noticed that we tend to write almost the same subtasks for both platforms when implementing new features into our apps. I consider this a vital sign, showing that we have managed to achieve a harmony between our native implementations for iOS and Android. Therefore, I have decided to share some of the know-how and experience, which we have collected throughout the last months.


### Firebase in a weekend
* [Get up and running on Firebase this weekend with Firebase in a Weekend](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2016/11/get-up-and-running-on-firebase.html) (Nov 9, 2016) - Today we are launching a complete end-to-end video training course called "Firebase in a Weekend". Whether you develop Android or iOS apps, the training course helps you understand many of the core features of Firebase, learned by building an app from the ground up.
	* [Firebase in a Weekend: Android](https://www.udacity.com/course/firebase-in-a-weekend-by-google-android--ud0352) - In this course, you’ll learn how to use Firebase. Firebase is an app development platform that provides developers a variety of tools and a scalable infrastructure to build high quality apps. We’ll begin by showing you how easy it is to read and write almost any data to Firebase. After that, we’ll teach you how to allow users to login, have data associated with them and send them notifications. You’ll learn how to use Firebase’s Security and Rules language to secure and add permissions to your data. Firebase Remote Config gives you the ability to tune and customize your app without having to publish a new version. Finally we’ll give you a brief overview of Firebase Analytics so you can collect data from the start. By the end of this course you will have an Android application that can store and share data between different users in real time as well as authenticate and authorize those users.
* [Exploring Firebase on Android & iOS: Remote Config](https://medium.com/@hitherejoe/exploring-firebase-on-android-ios-remote-config-3e1407b088f6) (Oct 14, 2016) by [Joe Birch](https://medium.com/@hitherejoe) - Remote config is a feature of Firebase suite that allows us to alter both the look and feel of our application without the need to publish any updates to the Google Play or App store. This works by allowing us to define in-app parameters that can be overridden from within the firebase console — these parameters can then be activated for either all or a defined selection of users.
* [Exploring Firebase on Android & iOS: Analytics](https://medium.com/exploring-android/exploring-firebase-on-android-ios-analytics-8484b61a21ba) (Sep 8, 2016) by [Joe Birch](https://medium.com/@hitherejoe) - Firebase is an exciting new collection of services that I’ve been reading up on and experimenting with. In this chapter, we’re going to be taking a look at Firebase Analytics — the integration that allows us to begin tracking user and application data in just a few steps.


### Android Vision Magnifier
* [kloener/visor-android](https://github.com/kloener/visor-android) - Visor is a magnifying glass for your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. Enlarge difficult to read text by 4 magnification levels and change contrast to 5 different viewing modes. Optionally, turn on the LED flash of your device to help you see better in low-light conditions. There is an offical android version of the visor app - the low vision magnifier available in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.visorapp.visor).


### Swagger, working with
* [Speed up your RESTful API development in Node.js with Swagger](https://scotch.io/tutorials/speed-up-your-restful-api-development-in-node-js-with-swagger) (Jul 9, 2016) - in this tutorial I want to introduce Swagger, a famous open-source framework to help you write RESTful APIs. One feature I like is the mock mode, which allows developers to design routes without writing a single line of code in javascript. This is the approach I am going to follow in this tutorial: We first focus on the design and then on the code. In the tutorial we are going create a RESTful API to manage our movies collection. We covered all the basic requests, GET, POST, DELETE, UPDATE to manage a movie collection. At the same time we practiced with parameters by handling them from the body or the path. The same can be done to handle parameters from the header of course, **so I have a challenge for you.** On Scotch.io there is a cool [tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/authenticate-a-node-js-api-with-json-web-tokens) to authenticate a node.js API with JSON web tokens. Why don't you try to rewrite with swagger to practice with header parameters?


### Laravel, getting started with
* [Getting Started With Laravel](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-laravel--cms-25386) (Jan 19, 2016) - In this article I’ll show you how to get started with Laravel by installing everything that’s needed to run the system, showing you how to use Laravel Homestead—a great virtual machine—and finally, how to install Laravel itself.
* [Laravel Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/homestead) - Laravel Homestead is an official, pre-packaged Vagrant box that provides you a wonderful development environment without requiring you to install PHP, a web server, and any other server software on your local machine. No more worrying about messing up your operating system! Vagrant boxes are completely disposable. If something goes wrong, you can destroy and re-create the box in minutes!
* [Laravel Quickstart](https://laravel.com/docs/4.2/quick) - quickstart a Laravel project, project structure description, deploy instructions.


### Node, working with
* [MEAN App From Scratch - MongoDB, Express, Angular 2 & NodeJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFP0oXNNveg) (Oct 1, 2016) - In this video we will build a complete MEAN application from scratch. The MEAN stack includes MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node.js. Code on [GitHub](https://github.com/bradtraversy/mean_mytasklist) (MEAN application to manage tasks).
* [Node Hero - Getting Started With Node.js Tutorial](https://blog.risingstack.com/node-hero-tutorial-getting-started-with-node-js/) (Mar, 2016) - This is the first post of an upcoming Node.js tutorial series called Node Hero - in these chapters, you can learn how to get started with Node.js and deliver software products using it.

* [Node.js Interview Questions and Answers (2017 Edition)](https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-interview-questions-and-answers-2017/) - It is never a good practice to judge someone just by questions like these, but these can give you an overview of the person's experience in Node.js. But obviously, these questions do not give you the big picture of someone's mindset and thinking. I think that a real-life problem can show a lot more of a candidate's knowledge - so we encourage you to do pair programming with the developers you are going to hire.
* [65 JavaScript Interview Questions and Answers](https://www.webcodegeeks.com/javascript/javascript-interview-questions-answers/) (Dec 30, 2015) - Have you wondered what are the most common Javascript questions developers are asked in interviews? Well, in this article we’re going to go through some of the most anticipated questions (and their answers) to help you get going in job interviews and make a good impression with your knowledge.


### Centralized logging
* [Gravity Tech: Centralized logging (and more) with Apache Kafka](http://blog.gravityrd.com/tech-centralized-logging-apache-kafka/) (Jun 18, 2015) - While messaging systems abound (see [queues.io](http://queues.io/) for a long list), [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) is a messaging system designed specifically for log transmission. Apart from the human-readable text lines emitted by applications for debugging purposes (commonly referred to as application logs), the word “log” here refers to any stream of events or updates; for instance user activity streams or snapshots of application metrics. Thus, when Gravity developers were looking for a log aggregation solution, Kafka was a natural choice.
* [Apache Kafka - Quick Guide](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/apache_kafka/apache_kafka_quick_guide.htm) - Kafka is designed for distributed high throughput systems. Kafka tends to work very well as a replacement for a more traditional message broker. In comparison to other messaging systems, Kafka has better throughput, built-in partitioning, replication and inherent fault-tolerance, which makes it a good fit for large-scale message processing applications.
* [Apache Kafka, Data Pipelines, and Functional Reactive Programming with Node.js](https://blog.heroku.com/kafka-data-pipelines-frp-node) (Nov 29, 2016) - Heroku recently released a managed Apache Kafka offering. As a Node.js developer, I wanted to demystify Kafka by sharing a simple yet practical use case with the many Node.js developers who are curious how this technology might be useful. I wanted a data source that was simple to explain to others and from which I could get a high rate of message throughput, so I chose to use data from the Twitter Stream API, as keyword-defined tweet streams fit these needs perfectly. Fast, reliable, and scalable.
* [How-to: Do Real-Time Log Analytics with Apache Kafka, Cloudera Search, and Hue](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2015/02/how-to-do-real-time-log-analytics-with-apache-kafka-cloudera-search-and-hue/) (Feb 27, 2015) - If you are not looking at your company’s operational logs, then you are at a competitive disadvantage in your industry. Web server logs, application logs, and system logs are all valuable sources of operational intelligence, uncovering potential revenue opportunities and helping drive down the bottom line.
* [Apache Kafka on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/kafka-on-heroku) (Dec 22, 2016) - Apache Kafka on Heroku is an add-on that provides Kafka as a service with full integration into the Heroku platform. Apache Kafka is a distributed commit log for fast, fault-tolerant communication between producers and consumers using message based topics. Kafka provides the messaging backbone for building a new generation of distributed applications capable of handling billions of events and millions of transactions, and is designed to move large volumes of ephemeral data with a high degree of reliability and fault tolerance.
* [Apache Kafka - Use cases](https://kafka.apache.org/uses) - Here is a description of a few of the popular use cases for Apache Kafka™. For an overview of a number of these areas in action, see [this blog post](http://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying).
* [Apache Kafka: an Essential Overview](https://anturis.com/blog/apache-kafka-an-essential-overview/) (Sep 22, 2015) - To use an old term to describe something relatively new, Apache Kafka is messaging middleware. It is designed to send data from one server to another in a fault-tolerant, high-capacity way and, depending on the configuration, verify the receipt of sent data. In performance tests it has been shown to be able to do two million writes per second. In addition to being software, Kafka is also a protocol, like TCP. In other words, it operates at the transport layer of the OSI model. You can think of it as an extremely high-capacity syslog. Kafka was written by LinkedIn and is now an open source Apache product. They wrote it in Scala. LinkedIn and other companies use Kafka to read data feeds and organize them into topics.
* [heroku-kafka-demo-nodejs](https://github.com/apiaryio/heroku-kafka-demo-nodejs) - A simple heroku app that demonstrates using Kafka in NodeJS. This demo app accepts HTTP POST requests and writes them to a topic, and has a simple page that shows the last 10 messages produced to that topic.
* [log4mongo/log4mongo-java](https://github.com/log4mongo/log4mongo-java) - log4j appender to MongoDB database http://log4mongo.org
* [Nogger](https://paulem.eu/nogger/) (Mar 26, 2015) - Last year I created a monitoring tool with node.js to view log files and metrics from a server. I did this as a project for my university and made it open source. The name of this baby is [Nogger](https://github.com/paul-em/nogger) - an acronym for **no**dejs lo**g** read**er**.
* [log.io](http://logio.org/) - Real-time log monitoring in your browser. Powered by node.js + socket.io


### Facility Management Software (aka CMMS - Computerized Maintenance Management System)
* [Computerized maintenance management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computerized_maintenance_management_system) - Computerized maintenance management system (CMMS), is also known as computerized maintenance management information system (CMMIS), is a software package that maintains a computer database of information about an organization's maintenance operations.[1] This information is intended to help maintenance workers do their jobs more effectively (for example, determining which machines require maintenance and which storerooms contain the spare parts they need) and to help management make informed decisions (for example, calculating the cost of machine breakdown repair versus preventive maintenance for each machine, possibly leading to better allocation of resources). CMMS data may also be used to verify regulatory compliance.
