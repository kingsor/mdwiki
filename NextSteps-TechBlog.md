### Vue.js
Vue is a progressive JavaScript framework that focuses on building user interfaces. As it only works in the “view layer” it makes no assumption of middleware and backend and therefore can be integrated easily into other projects and libraries. Vue.js offers a lot of functionality for the view layer and can be used for building powerful single-page webapps. In the following you can find a list of features:

* Reactive Interfaces
* Declarative Rendering
* Data Binding
* Directives
* Template Logic
* Components
* Event Handling
* Computed Properties
* CSS Transitions and Animations
* Filters

The Vue.js 2 core library is very small in size (only 17 kB). This ensures that the overhead which is added to your project by using Vue.js is minimal and your website is loading fast.

In the following we’re going to build a real-world Vue.js 2 application which makes use of an external REST API from Newsapi.org. By using this free API we’re able to retrieve latest news articles from popular news sources and blogs. To access this external API we’re going to use the vue-resource packages which provides a service for making web requests and handle responses.

* [Upwork Review: Why It’s a Battle YOU Won’t Win](http://launchastartup.com/odesk-vs-elance/) (Aug 13, 2017) - On the surface, Freelancer.com and Upwork look like they’re great places for quality contractors to make money. They also seem like they’re great places for businesses to save money and get the services that they need.  Yet there are a lot of horror stories out there about these sites. In many cases, each party is having to accept “good enough” because of business necessity.  While there are quality contractors on Freelancer and Upwork, a lot of that is attributed to the fact that they are the biggest players in the freelance market. While comparisons of Upwork vs Elance vs Freelancer vs Guru continue to grow as the online job market has skyrocketed, we’ll delve into a couple of problems of the current freelance model and potential solutions.

In trouble with async/await with ShortURL project.
I found the right solution in this Stackoverflow answer ([Calling an async method from a non-async method](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8438786/calling-an-async-method-from-a-non-async-method)).

But I was able to understand a little bit more about the cause from these links:

* [Synchronously waiting for an async operation, and why does Wait() freeze the program here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14485115/synchronously-waiting-for-an-async-operation-and-why-does-wait-freeze-the-pro)

[Replacing Fireworks With 500 Drones Is Brilliant and Very Annoying](http://gizmodo.com/replacing-fireworks-with-500-drones-is-brilliant-and-ve-1788615129) (Nov 5, 2016)
Fireworks are dangerous, loud and can only be used once—that’s what makes them fun. Intel has just made its intentions clear that it wants to completely ruin that fun with its small quadcopters that it calls Shooting Stars. Unfortunately, that’s probably a good idea.

In a blog post, [Intel](https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/intel-and-drone-technology-breaking-new-ground/) announced that it has made significant progress with its fake fireworks drone program and officially gave it a name. The computer chip giant also claimed victory by setting a new Guinness World Record for most the Most UAVs airborne simultaneously when it flew 500 Shooting Stars to create a spectacular light show.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aOd4-T_p5fA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[Intel Drones light up the sky](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/technology-innovation/aerial-technology-light-show.html)
Our record-breaking flights take the wonders of drone technology and transform them into an entirely new form of entertainment. With Intel, brands have the power to brighten up the night sky with a perfectly choreographed light show with hundreds of drones—creating a stunning way to communicate.

### Message Queues
[Message Queues & You – 12 Reasons to Use Message Queuing](https://stackify.com/message-queues-12-reasons/) - At [Stackify](https://stackify.com/), we receive a lot of data from your apps to our [Retrace](https://stackify.com/retrace/) APIs. We queue all of that data as soon as it gets to us, and then we use separate background services to process the data. Message queues help a lot with ensuring data is never lost, traffic spikes, etc. We decided to put together a list of why you should be using message queues!

1. Redundancy via Persistence
2. Traffic Spikes
3. Improve Web Application Page Load Times
4. Batching for Efficiency
5. Asynchronous Messaging
6. Decouple by Using Data Contracts
7. Transaction Ordering and Concurrency Challenges
8. Improve Scalability
9. Create Resiliency
10. Guarantee Transaction Occurs Once
11. Break Larger Tasks into Many Smaller Ones
12. Monitoring

Message queues are a very critical component to our platform at Stackify. We queue and process billions of messages a month. For us, it would be hard to imagine not having message queues!

It can be a lot of work to stand up RabbitMQ, MSMQ or some other message queuing service. Although, Azure and AWS make it easier with their hosted offerings. We use Azure Service Bus ourselves and it has worked well for us.

### Amazon AWS

In this post I’m not commenting on the validity of this style of interview (though I do personally find whiteboard coding a useful way to see how candidates work through problems) but instead pointing out some common pitfalls that can be avoided, given that this is how tech companies interview.

* [Singleton in C# – Pattern or Anti-pattern](http://www.dotnetcurry.com/patterns-practices/1350/singleton-design-anti-pattern-csharp) - Singleton is one of the basic software design patterns from the Gang of four book. It is an appropriate choice for providing managed access to unique external resources, but can quickly be abused by storing global state in it. Even without that, it can introduce difficulties when writing unit tests or developing multi/threaded applications.  
As an alternative to singletons, we can pass the instance as an explicit dependency to class constructors that need it. To make this process easier, we can use a dependency injection library. Some application frameworks already have such a library built into them which can provide a complete replacement for the singleton pattern.

Inheritance, however has its own place in programming, and often times is a necessary evil. In this post, we explored Abstract Interfaces which combine the power of Interfaces with Inheritance. Abstract Interface is a term for Abstract Class, which implements all the functionality of an Interface. Abstract Interfaces always go with the Interfaces they are supporting.

I've tried to run a mongo docker image on docker toolbox on my machine. But there was a problem with the http/https proxy settings.
So I exported the oracle docker image (that I use for work), removed the docker-machine, created it again with no proxy configuration, tested the mongodb docker image creation (that worked fine), imported the previous exported image and that's all.  
Every thing works fine as before, but now I can test docker images creation to play with.

[Running MongoDB as a Docker container](https://www.thachmai.info/2015/04/30/running-mongodb-container/) (Apr30, 2015)

Then I run ShortUrl project against that mongodb instance. And everything went fine.
Then I run some mongodb commands on the webmarks db.

I was curious about a thing Endri told me. He made application to a job offer  and after a skype call and github analysis by recruiter, he was asked to solve a [homework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iHd1YFmjkf9JMa9jYLFXVgtQC0hosgyRmQDpFL4R-H8/pub).
As I know looking for job offers mainly in Europe, this is a common practice, even if analysing the candidate code in github may be sufficient. Usually I see the request for a technical interview. Only Toptal require a more articulated selection process through four steps.
The homework is composed by two user stories. And I like it the way is described.



Something about the job offer: [Full Stack Developer - Milan](https://www.reviso.com/careers/full-stack-developer-milan)

* Currently we are looking for a Full Stack Web Developer to grow/start a team working in our Milano headquarter.
* You will be working on [Reviso](https://www.reviso.com/), a cloud accounting platform running on a micro service enabled Microsoft/JavaScript stack. We're a team of 12 dedicated developers in 3 locations: Denmark, Milan, and Catania.
* You will be reporting to our Milanese team lead but is expected to work closely with your colleagues in the other locations.

Something about the company

* [TeamSystem Cloud Division](http://www.teamsystem.com/store/soluzioni-cloud/) is building a new and exciting product, [Reviso](http://www.teamsystem.com/store/soluzioni-cloud/gestione-contabile/), that will take accounting – the language of business – and make it accessible and easy to learn – so business owners and their accountants can talk together, in the same language.
* We’re creating an advanced online accounting software platform, with an intuitive and fast to learn interface - while keeping a strong focus on efficiency and collaboration. The platform is built using modern principles like REST and single page applications.
* We're a truly distributed organization: Our development headquarter is located in the heart of Copenhagen, Denmark, and we have offices in London, Berlin, Madrid, Catania and Milan.

They has an [API & Developer](https://www.reviso.com/developer) section.
These are some basic link to their APIs:

* https://rest.reviso.com/
* https://rest.reviso.com/customers
* https://rest.reviso.com/customers?demo=true

And this is the homework content:

### Reviso Developer Homework
Here is the [doc link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iHd1YFmjkf9JMa9jYLFXVgtQC0hosgyRmQDpFL4R-H8/pub)

As a part of the Reviso recruitment process we always ask our candidates to complete a practical development challenge. The challenge consists of two parts:

* You do your magic, solve the provided task, and send the results to us.
* We host a session where you present your solution to us, and we all have a nice talk about it.

The task is to implement a simple web application that solves the following two user stories:

* As a freelancer I want to be able to register the time I spend on my projects, so that I can create correct invoices for my customers.
* As a freelancer I want to be able to get an overview of my time registrations, so that I can create correct invoices for my customers.

Keep in mind that we do not expect your code to be production ready. What we're looking for is to see if you have the ability to transform a set of user requirements into a working tool, preferably creating some nice and clean code along the way. We will appreciate if your solution is:

* Working
* Easy to use
* SOLID
* Maintainable
* Testable

When presenting the solution you’re welcome to bring your own laptop if that suits you better.

In case you have questions, please do not hesitate to ask.

Happy coding :)

* [Object Oriented Programming (OOP)](http://www.dotnetcurry.com/software-gardening/1125/object-oriented-programming-oops)

### SOLID Principles
First introduced by Robert “Uncle Bob” Martin, SOLID is not new. Uncle Bob simply took concepts that had been around for years and put them together. However, he didn’t have them in SOLID order. We can credit Michael Feathers for coming up with the SOLID acronym.

So, what is SOLID? Well, it is five OOP principles, the first letter of each spelling out SOLID:

* [Single Responsibility Principle](http://www.dotnetcurry.com/software-gardening/1148/solid-single-responsibility-principle) (Jul 3, 2015)
* [Open-Closed Principle](http://www.dotnetcurry.com/software-gardening/1176/solid-open-closed-principle) (Sep 5, 2015)
* [Liskov Substitution Principle](http://www.dotnetcurry.com/software-gardening/1235/liskov-substitution-principle-lsp-solid-patterns) (Jan 11, 2016)
* [Interface Segregation Principle](http://www.dotnetcurry.com/software-gardening/1257/interface-segregation-principle-isp-solid-principle) (Mar 7, 2016)
* [Dependency Injection - SOLID Principles](http://www.dotnetcurry.com/software-gardening/1284/dependency-injection-solid-principles) (May 22, 2016)

And here are the SOLID principles described by [Exception Not Found](https://www.exceptionnotfound.net/):

* [SOLID in C#: The Single Responsibility Principle](https://www.exceptionnotfound.net/simply-solid-the-single-responsibility-principle/) (Mar 2, 2015)
* [SOLID in C#: The Open/Closed Principle](https://www.exceptionnotfound.net/simply-solid-the-open-closed-principle/) (Mar 3, 2015)

### Design Patterns
* [Introducing the Daily Design Pattern](https://www.exceptionnotfound.net/introducing-the-daily-design-pattern/) (Jun 1, 2016) by [Exception Not Found](https://www.exceptionnotfound.net/)
* [Introduzione ai design pattern](https://msdn.microsoft.com/it-it/library/cc185081.aspx) da Riccardo Golia ( Microsoft MVP Solutions Architect) - Introduzione ai design pattern, tassonomia dei più diffusi per poi descrivere in articoli successivi quali design pattern sono presenti nel .NET framework.

* [Todo-Backend](https://www.todobackend.com/) - The Todo-Backend project helps showcase and compare different language and framework combinations for building web services. This website defines a simple web API in the form of a todo list and users can create their own identical APIs using various tech stacks. This website then provides a spec runner to verify that the user implementation is identical to the base implementation.  The Todo-Backend project was inspired by the [TodoMVC project](http://todomvc.com/), and some code (specifically the todo client app) was borrowed directly from TodoMVC.
* [TodoMVC App Template](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc-app-template) - Template used for creating [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) apps.

* [Authentication overview with Nancy](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/Authentication-overview) - Explaining the authentication support in Nancy is pretty easy - there really is not any. That is not to say that you cannot do authentication with Nancy, or that it is not on the “super duper happy path”, but at the core Nancy contains only some very basic constructs around authentication, which other packages (or your own) can take advantage of to provide many types of authentication. What this means is that if the default implementations we ship in the box do not suit your business needs, you can simply write your own without having to worry about conforming to a complex set of predefined interfaces, base classes, or other constraints that a hard coded authentication awareness would impose on you.
* [Creating a Single Page Todo App with Node and Angular](https://scotch.io/tutorials/creating-a-single-page-todo-app-with-node-and-angular) - Today we will be creating a very simple Todo application using the MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) stack. We will be creating:

I'd like to use MongoDB for my first version of Webmarks and I want to identify which entities I need and how to structure the collections.
Firstly I read the following posts:

* [SQL vs NoSQL: The Differences](https://www.sitepoint.com/sql-vs-nosql-differences/) (Sep 18, 2015)
* [SQL vs NoSQL: How to Choose](https://www.sitepoint.com/sql-vs-nosql-choose/) (Sep 23, 2015)
* [Using JOINs in MongoDB NoSQL Databases](https://www.sitepoint.com/using-joins-in-mongodb-nosql-databases/) (Sep 30, 2016)

Now I want to read also this post: [NoSQL Databases: a Survey and Decision Guidance](https://medium.baqend.com/nosql-databases-a-survey-and-decision-guidance-ea7823a822d) (Aug 15, 2016) (26 min read) about how to choose a repository.
I'd like to read also this post: [To SQL or NoSQL? That’s the database question](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/to-sql-or-nosql-thats-the-database-question/) (Mar 30, 2016) in order to understand the differences between various NoSQL engines.

At the same time I'm figuring out which are the entities I need.

* Users - user infos for logging and preferences purposes
* Entries - every entry saved by each user
* Logs - logs about user access (may I use Firebase?)

I need to investigate about Wallabag db schema in order to understand how they solved this issue.

An overview on Cloud platforms.

* [AWS vs Azure vs Google: Cloud platforms compared](http://www.networksasia.net/article/aws-vs-azure-vs-google-cloud-platforms-compared.1488273117) (Feb 28, 2017) - Amazon Web Services is the consensus leader of the IaaS public cloud computing market according to industry watchers, but they credit Microsoft for closing the gap with Azure and say Google with its Cloud Platform has made considerable strides as well. Gartner estimates the IaaS market stood at $25.3 billion in 2016, on its way to a $45 billion market by 2018. With more and more workloads going to the cloud, and the top vendors being as competitive as they’ve been, deciding on which provider to go with isn’t getting any easier. This handy guide will outline the pros and cons of each provider and deliver tips about which one to go with.

Again about Neetpiq site - there are some sites I take into account as inspiring sites.

* [Postlight](https://postlight.com/) - Postlight is a digital product studio in New York City. We take your ideas and run. We design experiences, build prototypes, and ship scalable apps and platforms.
	* [Postlight Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/Postlight/) - We aim to build a network of like-minded individuals beyond our own team. We're going to throw as many parties as we can, host as many speakers as we can, and [share whatever we learn](http://posts.postlight.com/) with the community.
	* [Postlight at a year!](https://trackchanges.postlight.com/postlight-at-a-year-8e62b108208c) - We’re having our [one-year anniversary tonight](http://www.meetup.com/Postlight/events/234302875/), and launching [Postlight Labs](https://postlight.com/labs/). It’s been a lot of preparation—we’re in our new office, announcing some new products, with a new website. We’ve rehearsed five times. We have good-looking books to give away (thanks to the design team). Nearly 300 people RSVPed and we would have been okay with 60, so we’ve been adapting our plans and ordered another pallet of beer (plus non-alcoholic beverages; we do our best to include everyone).
	* [Postlight Labs](https://postlight.com/labs/) - At Postlight Labs, we work fast and we take risks. Our mission is simple: to prove out ideas through new approaches in design and technology by shipping great digital products. We make sure that what we’re building is real software that makes an impact.
	* [Track Changes](https://trackchanges.postlight.com/) - We know technology. And we know product. We share what we know in Track Changes, our popular newsletter and podcast.
	* [Practice](https://postlight.com/practice/) - Thoughts on engineering, design, & product management from the Postlight Track Changes podcast.
* [Nothing Magical](http://nothingmagical.com/) - this was a site of a one-man-band very similar to what I'm trying to do. But from the last time I visited the site, it has changed layout and now it looks like a very minimalistic site. Shame on me.
* [Jeroen Mols](http://jeroenmols.com/) - it's a personal blog hosted on Github using GitHub pages and Jekyll about an Android Developer I follow. He use the same template of my web site ([Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/)), but has improved his site with a front-page based on the free Bootstrap [Freelance theme](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/). Very nice and effective.
	* [jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme) - Jekyll theme based on Freelancer Start Bootstrap theme. Here is the [demo](https://jeromelachaud.github.io/freelancer-theme/).
	* [One Page Ethereal Template](https://onepagelove.com/ethereal) - 'Ethereal' is a free One Page HTML template featuring a unique horizontal-scrolling layout. The template is suited for anyone after a refreshing personal site or can even act as a minimal photography portfolio. Features include smooth scrolling horizontal browsing (and swiping on tablet), colorful background gradients, pop-up image gallery and a smart contact form.

	* Red teaming. Red teaming is when a team member becomes client advocate in testing work before it goes out to the client. That person should have been involved with the brief at the start, then loop back to make sure the work is as expected, to quality and understandable.
	* [Red Teaming](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/auditing/red-teaming-art-ethical-hacking-1272) - Red Teaming is a process designed to detect network and system vulnerabilities and test security by taking an attacker-like approach to system/network/data access. This process is also called "ethical hacking" since its ultimate purpose is to enhance security.
* [jwasham/coding-interview-university](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) - A complete computer science study plan to become a software engineer. From the author: I originally created this as a short to-do list of study topics for becoming a software engineer, but it grew to the large list you see today. After going through this study plan, I got hired as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon! You probably won't have to study as much as I did. Anyway, everything you need is here. The items listed here will prepare you well for in an interview at just about any software company, including the giants: Amazon, Facebook, Google or Microsoft.

UrlContent project - starting from [ShortUrl](https://github.com/horsdal/ShortURL) by [Christian Horsdal](https://github.com/horsdal).
The following are the articles written by [Christian Horsdal](https://github.com/horsdal) about the  ShortUrl project:

* [Frictionless .NET Web App Development with Nancy](http://www.horsdal-consult.dk/2011/10/frictionless-net-web-app-development.html) (Oct 10, 2011)
* [Frictionless .NET Web App Development with Nancy Part II - Introducing a View Engine](http://www.horsdal-consult.dk/2011/10/frictionless-net-web-app-development_16.html) (Oct 16, 2011)

Starting from his project, I modified it in order to save url metadata too.
The original visual studio solution is structured in four different projects.

* ShortUrl - the class lib that contains all the stuff related to the functionalities of the app
* ShortUrlTest - the unit test project
* ShortUrlDesktopApp - a console app that start ShortUrl as a self-hosted HTTP server
* ShortUrlWebApp - the web app that expose ShortUrl lib features

Currently I created a solution, UrlContent, with the following projects:

* UrlContentLib - the class lib containing the whole app features
* UrlContentConsole - console app exposing the lib features as self-hosted HTTP server
* UrlContentTest - to be created
* UrlContentWeb - to be created

Here I will list the features I want for my app.

* users management
* user can insert/delete a webmark
* user can list his/her webmarks
* user can archive, star his/her webmarks

Here are some usefull links in order to implement the features I figured out for the app.

* [Janus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus) - In ancient Roman religion and myth, Janus is the god of beginnings, gates, transitions, time, duality, doorways, passages, and endings. He is usually depicted as having two faces, since he looks to the future and to the past. It is conventionally thought that the month of January is named for Janus (Ianuarius), but according to ancient Roman farmers' almanacs Juno was the tutelary deity of the month.
