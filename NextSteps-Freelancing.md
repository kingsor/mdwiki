## HowTo
* [How i freelance? attributes required for full time freelancing](http://www.michaelhoughton.com/article/how-i-freelance-attributes-required-for-full-time-freelancing) (Nov 10, 2016) - After 6 months on the Toptal core team, I recently went back into full time freelancing - doing PHP development. My experience on the Toptal core team was amazing, however I missed the freelancing lifestyle and found working around meetings and schedules at times very stressful. While being a freelancer does comes with risks and certainly isn't for everyone - I would love to take the time to highlight what I love about freelancing and how I like to work!
* [How to move from full time employment to full time freelancing?](http://www.michaelhoughton.com/article/how-to-move-from-full-time-employment-to-full-time-freelancing) (Dec 12, 2016) - I have been freelancing full time for the majority of my 12 year career. Freelancing was something I had always dreamt about doing - I wanted to be my own boss and run my own business - and freelancing has allowed me to do just that! More importantly it gives me the freedom to choose the types of projects to work on and be selective about the clients I work with. The aim of this article is to help clarify the steps which a Developer needs to take to break into freelancing.

* [Working Remotely at GitLab: An update](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/03/04/remote-working-gitlab/) (Mar 4, 2016) - In April 2015, we published the Remote Manifesto on our blog. There were 9 people in the company at that time, which means we've grown over 600% during that time, with 54 people on our team as I write this.
* [How to Find and Get Hired for a Remote Job](https://zapier.com/blog/remote-work-jobs/) (Jan 31, 2017) - For many people, remote work is the ideal way to work. You get the income stability and benefits of being an employee, plus the freedom to work wherever fits you best. You get to ditch the soul-crushing commute and, yes, work in your pajamas if you like. Before you throw out all your suits, though, you have to land the job. Here at Zapier, we're a 100% remote team and we get many applicants for our job openings. In our Customer Champion roles, for example, only 2% of applicants get a job fit interview and only 0.4% are hired. We're as picky as Yale–and so are other employers.

Take the [following suggestions](https://hotjar.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/REC/pages/32271037/Tips+for+Remote+Working) and make them your own! You are also welcome to add your suggestions to the following list. Kindly email any suggestions you’d like to share to Operations.

* Force yourself to take scheduled breaks (e.g. https://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique).
* Don’t have a break on your computer: get up, exercise, go out for a walk, do something else.
* Disconnect a few hours a day.
* Schedule your day. You can add your tasks to your calendar. This helps you focus and time-box properly.  (It can still be flexible).
* Use the calendar to block/assign time to friends and family (You could block time to meet a friend or have dinner with your family).
* Enjoy small rewards for accomplished tasks.
* If you cannot focus: stop working, go out to clear your mind. Solutions will come to you when you’re not in front of a desk.
* Use time management apps to review your productivity and pinpoint activities that are distracting you.

* [How To Go Remote](http://workdifferent.com/how-to-remote/) - Too often, the idea of running a distributed (remote) team is dismissed as only possible when the company is small. This week, Automattic showed us that it’s not only possible to have a fully distributed team at a large scale, but you become a billion dollar company doing it. In this HowToWD we are going to disassemble the learnings from Automattic into a format that can be easily implemented by any team.
