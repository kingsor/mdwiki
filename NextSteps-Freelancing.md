## HowTo
* [How i freelance? attributes required for full time freelancing](http://www.michaelhoughton.com/article/how-i-freelance-attributes-required-for-full-time-freelancing) (Nov 10, 2016) - After 6 months on the Toptal core team, I recently went back into full time freelancing - doing PHP development. My experience on the Toptal core team was amazing, however I missed the freelancing lifestyle and found working around meetings and schedules at times very stressful. While being a freelancer does comes with risks and certainly isn't for everyone - I would love to take the time to highlight what I love about freelancing and how I like to work!
* [How to move from full time employment to full time freelancing?](http://www.michaelhoughton.com/article/how-to-move-from-full-time-employment-to-full-time-freelancing) (Dec 12, 2016) - I have been freelancing full time for the majority of my 12 year career. Freelancing was something I had always dreamt about doing - I wanted to be my own boss and run my own business - and freelancing has allowed me to do just that! More importantly it gives me the freedom to choose the types of projects to work on and be selective about the clients I work with. The aim of this article is to help clarify the steps which a Developer needs to take to break into freelancing.

## Working remotely
* [The Remote Manifesto](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/04/08/the-remote-manifesto/) (Apr 8, 2015) - We all have been greatly helped by Scrum and the Agile manifesto. It freed us from waterfall planning and excessive process. But working remotely and continuous delivery need something more. At GitLab we love to work remotely, but that means we need to communicate as effectively as possible. The following are GitLab's eight principles for modern teams working remotely.
* [7 Remote Work Trends to take into consideration in 2017](http://remoters.net/remote-work-trends-2017)
* [How to work Remotely with 150+ people](https://medium.com/@jobv/how-to-work-remotely-with-150-people-89741118418c) (Jan 3, 2016) - Work asynchronously, keep a single source of truth, avoid management overhead and communicate.
* [Working Remotely at GitLab: An update](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/03/04/remote-working-gitlab/) (Mar 4, 2016) - In April 2015, we published the Remote Manifesto on our blog. There were 9 people in the company at that time, which means we've grown over 600% during that time, with 54 people on our team as I write this.
* [How to Remote](https://dev.to/andydangerous/how-to-remote) (Feb 15, 2017) - Working with a remote team has many advantages. It can also be hard to do effectively. This post is how to remote. As for why, maybe I'll cover that in the future.
* [How to Find and Get Hired for a Remote Job](https://zapier.com/blog/remote-work-jobs/) (Jan 31, 2017) - For many people, remote work is the ideal way to work. You get the income stability and benefits of being an employee, plus the freedom to work wherever fits you best. You get to ditch the soul-crushing commute and, yes, work in your pajamas if you like. Before you throw out all your suits, though, you have to land the job. Here at Zapier, we're a 100% remote team and we get many applicants for our job openings. In our Customer Champion roles, for example, only 2% of applicants get a job fit interview and only 0.4% are hired. We're as picky as Yale–and so are other employers.

## Resume
* [JSON Resume](http://jsonresume.org/)  
  JSON Resume is a community driven open source initiative to create a JSON based standard for resumes. There is no reason why there can't be a common standard for writing a resume that can be extended with an ecosystem of open source tools.

## Automattic
* [Remote @ Automattic](http://workdifferent.com/remote-automattic/) - The 10 year old company behind WordPress.com, Akismet, Jetpack and VaultPress, has a 100% distributed workforce of almost 400 people scattered across 37 countries, where all communication happens online, across different platforms, rapidly, often in acronyms, and entirely in public. There’s no email, no office, no set work hours, no vacation policy, and seemingly little in the way of structure.
* [How To Go Remote](http://workdifferent.com/how-to-remote/) - Too often, the idea of running a distributed (remote) team is dismissed as only possible when the company is small. This week, Automattic showed us that it’s not only possible to have a fully distributed team at a large scale, but you become a billion dollar company doing it. In this HowToWD we are going to disassemble the learnings from Automattic into a format that can be easily implemented by any team.
* [The New WordPress.com](https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/) - A single interface to manage all your WordPress.com or Jetpack-enabled sites, built with the latest web technologies and used by millions of people - and now it's open source.
	* [Installing Calypso](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/master/docs/install.md)
	* [Calypso Bootstrap](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso-bootstrap) - is a development environment for Calypso built with Vagrant and Puppet.
* [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/) - Your notes stay updated across all your devices. No buttons to press. It just works. Backups, syncing, sharing — it’s all completely free.
