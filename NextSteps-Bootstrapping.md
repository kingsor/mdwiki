# Start Small Stay Small
Principles and inspirations for a business I like to create and work on.


## Focus On
* [Random Thoughts and Lessons Learned From Bootstrapping a Side Project](http://www.dotnetsurfers.com/blog/2016/03/29/lessons-learned-and-random-thoughts-on-bootstrapping/) (Mar 29, 2016) - I have been working on my side project SQLSmash on and off for more than 3 years now. But I am not successful yet, at least not in the traditional sense. I have happy paying customers and make a little bit of money from it, but nowhere close to what I make at my day job. However, when I read about other people who have gone down a similar path, I get a lot out of their stories whether they are huge successes or not. So in the same spirit, here are some notes about my journey and what I have learned so far.
* [Steps to build an app and fail](https://medium.com/@fesja/steps-to-build-an-app-and-fail-d2959baf1e2d) (Nov 13, 2016) - The other day I met some entrepreneurs who had developed an app and they were wondering why nobody was using it. I’ve seen this scenario many times and it reminded me of myself when I was more naive.
* [#productidea 30 day challenge](https://medium.com/productidea-30-day-challenge/productidea-30-day-challenge-2de797a3beb7) (Feb 28, 2016) - I have tons of ideas continuously on how to improve experiences and products. I write down some of them just in case I decide to try them or help someone someday; but others disappear.


## Bootstrapped, Profitable, & Proud
* [Getting Real](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/toc.php) (Book) - Getting real is less. Less mass, less software, less features, less paperwork, less of everything that's not essential (and most of what you think is essential actually isn't). Getting Real is staying small and being agile. Getting Real starts with the interface, the real screens that people are going to use. It begins with what the customer actually experiences and builds backwards from there. This lets you get the interface right before you get the software wrong. Getting Real is about iterations and lowering the cost of change. Getting Real is all about launching, tweaking, and constantly improving which makes it a perfect approach for web-based software. Getting Real delivers just what customers need and eliminates anything they don't.
* [How to Start a Startup](http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html) (Mar 2005) by [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/) - You need three things to create a successful startup: *to start with good people*, *to make something customers actually want*, and *to spend as little money as possible*. Most startups that fail do it because they fail at one of these. A startup that does all three will probably succeed. And that's kind of exciting, when you think about it, because all three are doable. Hard, but doable. And since a startup that succeeds ordinarily makes its founders rich, that implies getting rich is doable too. Hard, but doable.
* [10 Reasons Why I Self-Funded My Startup and So Should You](http://yongfook.com/10-reasons-why-i-self-funded-my-startup-and-so-should-you.html) - This post is simply here to remind some of you why we do what we do. A message that often gets lost, in this world of funding-hungry startups. 8 months ago I started my company. And I never took a cent of outside funding. Here's why I think self-funding (also known as bootstrapping) is the best thing a young startup can do.
* [15 Reasons to Keep Your Company Small](http://readwrite.com/2014/05/05/keep-your-startup-small) - Despite all the headlines about billion-dollar exits and IPOs, growing too quickly or too much is not always the most desirable outcome for a startup. Fifteen entrepreneurs, members of [Young Entrepreneur Council](http://yec.co/) (YEC), offer their perspective on why, in some cases, smaller means mightier.
* [Reaching Escape Velocity as a Bootstrapper](http://www.softwarebyrob.com/2013/09/17/reaching-escape-velocity-as-a-bootstrapper/) by [Rob Walling](http://www.softwarebyrob.com/) author of [Start Small, Stay Small](http://www.startupbook.net/) book - Escape velocity, in physics, is basically the speed needed to break free from gravity. The idea of escape velocity also surfaces in regard to startups; David Cummings says that, “For startups, escape velocity has to do with becoming the dominant vendor and growing indefinitely.” Escape velocity for a bootstrapper might be freedom from the monthly bills, or freedom from a full-time job outside of their startup. Bootstrappers don’t need to escape from competition and become the “dominant vendor.” They require much less velocity because they are escaping a different kind of gravity.
* [Start something small](http://joel.is/start-something-small/) (Nov 2, 2012) by [Joel Gascoigne](http://joel.is/) co-founder and CEO at [Buffer](http://bufferapp.com/) - The challenge for a lot of us, is that when we go about our lives we interact with so many “big” things, and we forget or don’t even know how they originally started. What I’m starting to notice more and more, is that great things almost always start small. One of my most interesting realisations from this thinking and from seeing many examples is that actually in order to succeed, we probably should think and execute on a smaller level. 
* [Is Going for Rapid Growth Always Good? Aren’t Startups So Much More?](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2012/09/22/is-going-for-rapid-growth-always-good-arent-startups-so-much-more/) - I think I’ve read Paul Graham’s post on “Startup = Growth” three or four times now. And of course on Twitter I’ve seen the Tweets, ReTweets and superlatives on what a great post it is.
* [The Profitable Side Project Handbook](http://rachelandrew.co.uk/books/the-profitable-side-project) - Do you dream of being able to earn money while you sleep? Of seeing sales come in while you are out for dinner? Of creating a great product that is sustainable as a real, profitable business? Rachel Andrew has been there and done it, and she loves helping other people achieve the same success with their own products and side projects. In her practical new book, she’ll help you to get started and throughout all stages of the launch of your own revenue generating side project.
* [The lean startup](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/09/lean-startup.html) (Sep 8, 2008) by [Eric Ries](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/10/about-author.html) - In September, 2008 I wrote the following post in which I published my thoughts on the term "[lean startup](http://theleanstartup.com/)" for the first time. In the interests of preserving that history, I have left the original post unchanged and unedited.
* [Minimum Viable Product: a guide](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html) (Aug 3, 2009) by [Eric Ries](https://twitter.com/ericries) - One of the most important lean startup techniques is called the minimum viable product. Its power is matched only by the amount of confusion that it causes, because it's actually quite hard to do. It certainly took me many years to make sense of it. First, a definition: the minimum viable product is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of [validated learning about customers](http://startuplessonslearned.blogspot.com/2009/04/validated-learning-about-customers.html) with the least effort.

* [Venture Hacks interview: "What is the minimum viable product?"](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/03/minimum-viable-product.html) (March 23, 2009) by [Eric Ries](https://twitter.com/ericries) - The idea of minimum viable product is useful because you can basically say: our vision is to build a product that solves this core problem for customers and we think that for the people who are early adopters for this kind of solution, they will be the most forgiving. And they will fill in their minds the features that aren’t quite there if we give them the core, tent-pole features that point the direction of where we’re trying to go. So, the minimum viable product is that product which has just those features (and no more) that allows you to ship a product that resonates with early adopters; some of whom will pay you money or give you feedback. Read the [est of the interview at Venture Hacks](http://venturehacks.com/articles/minimum-viable-product).
* [What does a startup CTO actually do?](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/09/what-does-startup-cto-actually-do.html) (September 30, 2008) by [Eric Ries](https://twitter.com/ericries) - What does your Chief Technology Officer do all day? Often times, it seems like people are thinking it's synonymous with "that guy who gets paid to sit in the corner and think 'technical' deep thoughts" or "that guy who gets to swoop in a rearrange my project at the last minute on a whim." I've tried hard not to live up (or down?) to those stereotypes, but it's not easy. We lack a consistent and clear definition of the job.


## Unbundling - the formula for building a successfull app
Here is the [formula for building the next killer app](https://medium.com/on-coding/the-formula-for-creating-the-next-killer-app-bad2c9d88449):

1. Pick a massive tech product that’s used for loads of different purposes
2. Take one specific bit of its functionality
3. Turn that into a beautiful standalone app

This is generally known as **unbundling**, and it’s behind some of the most popular apps of the last 12 months.

## Quotes

* Una citazione di [Gianmarco Carnovale](https://www.facebook.com/groups/startupperSelfHelp/permalink/791907827622699/) by [Sergio Berisso](https://www.facebook.com/sergio.berisso)  
   "Sei stato finanziato", se intendi milioni sull'idea, non lo troverai in nessun luogo al mondo. Non funziona così il venture business. Con l'idea (e un team convincente) trovi chi ti finanzia qualche decina di migliaia di euro per validarla, che ti aiuterà a trovare i soldi del seed con cui validare il bm, e solo dopo "boom", e sei finanziato milioni da un vc. In Italia come in qualsiasi altro paese. A meno che non ci sei già passato per questo percorso con una startup precedente, e allora salti le tappe"
 
  "Con i 15k ci iniziano tutte le startup che passano da Startupbootcamp... e che fino a un anno fa quella fosse la stessa somma offerta da YCombinator.
Non è un'idea contorta, è esattamente come funziona questo comparto.
I founder lavorano gratis, all'inizio, finché non dimostrano di star facendo qualcosa di valido e di esserne in grado. I soldi servono come rimborso spese ("Pizza Money", come dicono negli acceleratori di Londra).
Gli stipendi li inizi a pagare quando fai il seed, all'inizio nessuno ti finanzia se il tuo modello è quello di un singolo imprenditore che intende assumere gente e pagare stipendi dal primo minuto.
Stiamo parlando di ABC del modello startup, è così in Italia come in Silicon Valley.
Ripeto: a meno che non ci sei già passato ed hai già dimostrato di saperlo fare. In quel caso avrai già dei fondi che ti conoscono e sono disposti a finanziarti senza che passi per i primi stage - che servono da filtro qualitativo"

## Misc
* [Knowing when, and how, to pivot (or, why didn’t news apps work?)](https://medium.com/@jason/knowing-when-and-how-to-pivot-or-why-didn-t-news-apps-work-8c6cb4f8227e#.donr07e0s) - I’ve been beating my head against a wall for the last two years trying to make a news app experience work, and despite great reviews, I’ve failed. So, we’re giving up on the Inside.com App and focusing 100% of our efforts on a medium that’s resulting in much better engagement — email!
* Metriche
	* Da quali canali arrivano i miei utenti, e quanti riesco ad attrarne? (metriche di acquisizione)

	* I miei utenti/clienti sono talmente soddisfatti
		* da tornare a trovarmi? E con quale frequenza? (metriche di retention)
		* da parlarne ad altri? (metriche di referral)
	* Questi comportamenti portano a qualche forma di monetizzazione? In che modo? Quanto e quando? (metriche di revenue)
* [Don’t Market Your App If You Don’t Know This – Pirate Metrics for Mobile Apps](http://appentrepreneursassociation.com/dont-market-your-app-if-you-dont-know-this-pirate-metrics-for-mobile-apps/) (Sep 26, 2014) - a concise post about pirate metrics to look at for a mobile app.
* [Vital Metrics For Tracking Your App’s Success](http://www.developereconomics.com/vital-metrics-tracking-app-success/) (Feb 02, 2015) - Making data driven decisions is key to driving growth in your mobile app, and it’s the reason that nearly every app developer in the world integrates analytics tracking within their app. In fact, in a recent Tapdaq survey we discovered that 90% of developers have implemented a third party analytics SDK into their app. However, we were surprised to then learn that only 5% of these developers knew what to do with the data points which they were tracking. After speaking with a large group of the developers questioned, we realised that many aren’t sure which metrics are most important, or what steps they need to take in order to improve. In this post I am going to pick out 12 app metrics and explain why they are the most important data points when tracking your app’s success.
* [Which Metrics Are Most Important for Optimizing CX?](http://blog.usabilla.com/which-metrics-are-most-important-for-optimizing-cx/) (Dec 17, 2015) - Providing the optimal customer experience is key to the success of your business, but such a broad concept can often be difficult to break down into measurable, trackable elements. We’re often faced with the question, “what exactly do we need to measure?” So we’ve complied a list of the most important things you should be tracking to optimize your customer experience.
* [How The Build-Measure-Learn Cycle Really Works](http://www.entrepreneurial-insights.com/how-build-measure-learn-cycle-really-works/) - In this article, we will 1) get a *basic understanding of the lean startup method and its advantages*, 2) learn about the *principles of the lean startup method*, 3) overview on the *build-measure-learn cycle*, and 4) an example of *how Zappos used the build-measure-learn cycle*.
* [Why Build, Measure, Learn – isn’t just throwing things against the wall to see if they work – the Minimal Viable Product](http://steveblank.com/2015/05/06/build-measure-learn-throw-things-against-the-wall-and-see-if-they-work/) by [Steve Blank](http://steveblank.com/about/) - I am always surprised when critics complain that the Lean Startup’s Build, Measure, Learn approach is nothing more than “throwing incomplete products out of the building to see if they work.” Unfortunately the Build, Measure, Learn diagram is the cause of that confusion. At first glance it seems like a fire-ready-aim process. It’s time to update Build, Measure, Learn to what we now know is the best way to build Lean startups. Here’s how.
* [Discovery](http://thedoers.co/glossary/discovery/) - Durante questa fase gli imprenditori si concentrano nel cercare la conferma di star lavorando su un problema realmente percepito dalle persone che hanno individuato come target, e su una soluzione allettante per lo stesso mercato.

Over time most hosts and FTP clients began to support SFTP, ensuring your files were transmitted over a secure connection. The process of deploying a site however remained the same.


## Retrospectives
* [The Rise and Fall of Everest (the App)](http://medium.stfi.re/@producthunt/the-rise-and-fall-of-everest-the-app-b0d2e6cb594c?sf=zoxpko#.51ibhbwo1) - Everest Co-founder Katherine Krug share the story about the rise and fall of the goal setting app. When the product launched in December 2012, Everest’s future was glaringly bright.
