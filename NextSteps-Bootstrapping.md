# Start Small Stay Small
Principles and inspirations for a business I like to create and work on.


## Focus On
* [Random Thoughts and Lessons Learned From Bootstrapping a Side Project](http://www.dotnetsurfers.com/blog/2016/03/29/lessons-learned-and-random-thoughts-on-bootstrapping/) (Mar 29, 2016) - I have been working on my side project SQLSmash on and off for more than 3 years now. But I am not successful yet, at least not in the traditional sense. I have happy paying customers and make a little bit of money from it, but nowhere close to what I make at my day job. However, when I read about other people who have gone down a similar path, I get a lot out of their stories whether they are huge successes or not. So in the same spirit, here are some notes about my journey and what I have learned so far.
* [Steps to build an app and fail](https://medium.com/@fesja/steps-to-build-an-app-and-fail-d2959baf1e2d) (Nov 13, 2016) - The other day I met some entrepreneurs who had developed an app and they were wondering why nobody was using it. I’ve seen this scenario many times and it reminded me of myself when I was more naive.
* [#productidea 30 day challenge](https://medium.com/productidea-30-day-challenge/productidea-30-day-challenge-2de797a3beb7) (Feb 28, 2016) - I have tons of ideas continuously on how to improve experiences and products. I write down some of them just in case I decide to try them or help someone someday; but others disappear.


## Bootstrapped, Profitable, & Proud
* [Getting Real](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/toc.php) (Book) - Getting real is less. Less mass, less software, less features, less paperwork, less of everything that's not essential (and most of what you think is essential actually isn't). Getting Real is staying small and being agile. Getting Real starts with the interface, the real screens that people are going to use. It begins with what the customer actually experiences and builds backwards from there. This lets you get the interface right before you get the software wrong. Getting Real is about iterations and lowering the cost of change. Getting Real is all about launching, tweaking, and constantly improving which makes it a perfect approach for web-based software. Getting Real delivers just what customers need and eliminates anything they don't.
* [How to Start a Startup](http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html) (Mar 2005) by [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/) - You need three things to create a successful startup: *to start with good people*, *to make something customers actually want*, and *to spend as little money as possible*. Most startups that fail do it because they fail at one of these. A startup that does all three will probably succeed. And that's kind of exciting, when you think about it, because all three are doable. Hard, but doable. And since a startup that succeeds ordinarily makes its founders rich, that implies getting rich is doable too. Hard, but doable.
* [10 Reasons Why I Self-Funded My Startup and So Should You](http://yongfook.com/10-reasons-why-i-self-funded-my-startup-and-so-should-you.html) - This post is simply here to remind some of you why we do what we do. A message that often gets lost, in this world of funding-hungry startups. 8 months ago I started my company. And I never took a cent of outside funding. Here's why I think self-funding (also known as bootstrapping) is the best thing a young startup can do.
* [15 Reasons to Keep Your Company Small](http://readwrite.com/2014/05/05/keep-your-startup-small) - Despite all the headlines about billion-dollar exits and IPOs, growing too quickly or too much is not always the most desirable outcome for a startup. Fifteen entrepreneurs, members of [Young Entrepreneur Council](http://yec.co/) (YEC), offer their perspective on why, in some cases, smaller means mightier.
* [Reaching Escape Velocity as a Bootstrapper](http://www.softwarebyrob.com/2013/09/17/reaching-escape-velocity-as-a-bootstrapper/) by [Rob Walling](http://www.softwarebyrob.com/) author of [Start Small, Stay Small](http://www.startupbook.net/) book - Escape velocity, in physics, is basically the speed needed to break free from gravity. The idea of escape velocity also surfaces in regard to startups; David Cummings says that, “For startups, escape velocity has to do with becoming the dominant vendor and growing indefinitely.” Escape velocity for a bootstrapper might be freedom from the monthly bills, or freedom from a full-time job outside of their startup. Bootstrappers don’t need to escape from competition and become the “dominant vendor.” They require much less velocity because they are escaping a different kind of gravity.
* [Start something small](http://joel.is/start-something-small/) (Nov 2, 2012) by [Joel Gascoigne](http://joel.is/) co-founder and CEO at [Buffer](http://bufferapp.com/) - The challenge for a lot of us, is that when we go about our lives we interact with so many “big” things, and we forget or don’t even know how they originally started. What I’m starting to notice more and more, is that great things almost always start small. One of my most interesting realisations from this thinking and from seeing many examples is that actually in order to succeed, we probably should think and execute on a smaller level. 
* [Is Going for Rapid Growth Always Good? Aren’t Startups So Much More?](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2012/09/22/is-going-for-rapid-growth-always-good-arent-startups-so-much-more/) - I think I’ve read Paul Graham’s post on “Startup = Growth” three or four times now. And of course on Twitter I’ve seen the Tweets, ReTweets and superlatives on what a great post it is.
* [The lean startup](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/09/lean-startup.html) (Sep 8, 2008) by [Eric Ries](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/10/about-author.html) - In September, 2008 I wrote the following post in which I published my thoughts on the term "[lean startup](http://theleanstartup.com/)" for the first time. In the interests of preserving that history, I have left the original post unchanged and unedited.
* [Minimum Viable Product: a guide](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html) (Aug 3, 2009) by [Eric Ries](https://twitter.com/ericries) - One of the most important lean startup techniques is called the minimum viable product. Its power is matched only by the amount of confusion that it causes, because it's actually quite hard to do. It certainly took me many years to make sense of it. First, a definition: the minimum viable product is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of [validated learning about customers](http://startuplessonslearned.blogspot.com/2009/04/validated-learning-about-customers.html) with the least effort.  
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E4ex0fejo8w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
* [Venture Hacks interview: "What is the minimum viable product?"](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/03/minimum-viable-product.html) (March 23, 2009) by [Eric Ries](https://twitter.com/ericries) - The idea of minimum viable product is useful because you can basically say: our vision is to build a product that solves this core problem for customers and we think that for the people who are early adopters for this kind of solution, they will be the most forgiving. And they will fill in their minds the features that aren’t quite there if we give them the core, tent-pole features that point the direction of where we’re trying to go. So, the minimum viable product is that product which has just those features (and no more) that allows you to ship a product that resonates with early adopters; some of whom will pay you money or give you feedback. Read the [est of the interview at Venture Hacks](http://venturehacks.com/articles/minimum-viable-product).
* [What does a startup CTO actually do?](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/09/what-does-startup-cto-actually-do.html) (September 30, 2008) by [Eric Ries](https://twitter.com/ericries) - What does your Chief Technology Officer do all day? Often times, it seems like people are thinking it's synonymous with "that guy who gets paid to sit in the corner and think 'technical' deep thoughts" or "that guy who gets to swoop in a rearrange my project at the last minute on a whim." I've tried hard not to live up (or down?) to those stereotypes, but it's not easy. We lack a consistent and clear definition of the job.


## Unbundling - the formula for building a successfull app
Here is the [formula for building the next killer app](https://medium.com/on-coding/the-formula-for-creating-the-next-killer-app-bad2c9d88449):

1. Pick a massive tech product that’s used for loads of different purposes
2. Take one specific bit of its functionality
3. Turn that into a beautiful standalone app

This is generally known as **unbundling**, and it’s behind some of the most popular apps of the last 12 months.

## Quotes

* Una citazione di [Gianmarco Carnovale](https://www.facebook.com/groups/startupperSelfHelp/permalink/791907827622699/) by [Sergio Berisso](https://www.facebook.com/sergio.berisso)  
   "Sei stato finanziato", se intendi milioni sull'idea, non lo troverai in nessun luogo al mondo. Non funziona così il venture business. Con l'idea (e un team convincente) trovi chi ti finanzia qualche decina di migliaia di euro per validarla, che ti aiuterà a trovare i soldi del seed con cui validare il bm, e solo dopo "boom", e sei finanziato milioni da un vc. In Italia come in qualsiasi altro paese. A meno che non ci sei già passato per questo percorso con una startup precedente, e allora salti le tappe"
 
  "Con i 15k ci iniziano tutte le startup che passano da Startupbootcamp... e che fino a un anno fa quella fosse la stessa somma offerta da YCombinator.
Non è un'idea contorta, è esattamente come funziona questo comparto.
I founder lavorano gratis, all'inizio, finché non dimostrano di star facendo qualcosa di valido e di esserne in grado. I soldi servono come rimborso spese ("Pizza Money", come dicono negli acceleratori di Londra).
Gli stipendi li inizi a pagare quando fai il seed, all'inizio nessuno ti finanzia se il tuo modello è quello di un singolo imprenditore che intende assumere gente e pagare stipendi dal primo minuto.
Stiamo parlando di ABC del modello startup, è così in Italia come in Silicon Valley.
Ripeto: a meno che non ci sei già passato ed hai già dimostrato di saperlo fare. In quel caso avrai già dei fondi che ti conoscono e sono disposti a finanziarti senza che passi per i primi stage - che servono da filtro qualitativo"

## Execution Strategies
* [Knowing when, and how, to pivot (or, why didn’t news apps work?)](https://medium.com/@jason/knowing-when-and-how-to-pivot-or-why-didn-t-news-apps-work-8c6cb4f8227e#.donr07e0s) - I’ve been beating my head against a wall for the last two years trying to make a news app experience work, and despite great reviews, I’ve failed. So, we’re giving up on the Inside.com App and focusing 100% of our efforts on a medium that’s resulting in much better engagement — email!
* [Don’t Market Your App If You Don’t Know This – Pirate Metrics for Mobile Apps](http://appentrepreneursassociation.com/dont-market-your-app-if-you-dont-know-this-pirate-metrics-for-mobile-apps/) (Sep 26, 2014) - a concise post about pirate metrics to look at for a mobile app.
* Metriche
	* Da quali canali arrivano i miei utenti, e quanti riesco ad attrarne? (metriche di acquisizione)
	* I miei clienti trovano l’offerta talmente interessante da volerne fruire? (metriche di attivazione)
	* I miei utenti/clienti sono talmente soddisfatti
		* da tornare a trovarmi? E con quale frequenza? (metriche di retention)
		* da parlarne ad altri? (metriche di referral)
	* Questi comportamenti portano a qualche forma di monetizzazione? In che modo? Quanto e quando? (metriche di revenue)
* [Vital Metrics For Tracking Your App’s Success](http://www.developereconomics.com/vital-metrics-tracking-app-success/) (Feb 02, 2015) - Making data driven decisions is key to driving growth in your mobile app, and it’s the reason that nearly every app developer in the world integrates analytics tracking within their app. In fact, in a recent Tapdaq survey we discovered that 90% of developers have implemented a third party analytics SDK into their app. However, we were surprised to then learn that only 5% of these developers knew what to do with the data points which they were tracking. After speaking with a large group of the developers questioned, we realised that many aren’t sure which metrics are most important, or what steps they need to take in order to improve. In this post I am going to pick out 12 app metrics and explain why they are the most important data points when tracking your app’s success.
* [Which Metrics Are Most Important for Optimizing CX?](http://blog.usabilla.com/which-metrics-are-most-important-for-optimizing-cx/) (Dec 17, 2015) - Providing the optimal customer experience is key to the success of your business, but such a broad concept can often be difficult to break down into measurable, trackable elements. We’re often faced with the question, “what exactly do we need to measure?” So we’ve complied a list of the most important things you should be tracking to optimize your customer experience.
* [How The Build-Measure-Learn Cycle Really Works](http://www.entrepreneurial-insights.com/how-build-measure-learn-cycle-really-works/) - In this article, we will 1) get a *basic understanding of the lean startup method and its advantages*, 2) learn about the *principles of the lean startup method*, 3) overview on the *build-measure-learn cycle*, and 4) an example of *how Zappos used the build-measure-learn cycle*.
* [Why Build, Measure, Learn – isn’t just throwing things against the wall to see if they work – the Minimal Viable Product](http://steveblank.com/2015/05/06/build-measure-learn-throw-things-against-the-wall-and-see-if-they-work/) by [Steve Blank](http://steveblank.com/about/) - I am always surprised when critics complain that the Lean Startup’s Build, Measure, Learn approach is nothing more than “throwing incomplete products out of the building to see if they work.” Unfortunately the Build, Measure, Learn diagram is the cause of that confusion. At first glance it seems like a fire-ready-aim process. It’s time to update Build, Measure, Learn to what we now know is the best way to build Lean startups. Here’s how.
* [Discovery](http://thedoers.co/glossary/discovery/) - Durante questa fase gli imprenditori si concentrano nel cercare la conferma di star lavorando su un problema realmente percepito dalle persone che hanno individuato come target, e su una soluzione allettante per lo stesso mercato.

[Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com/) site. You can login with twitter account (like Medium) and you can see your following/followers that has an account on Product Hunt. This is [my account](http://www.producthunt.com/kingsor).

* [The Origin of Product Hunt](https://medium.com/lets-make-things/the-origin-of-product-hunt-7acb09e2593a) - A story about building something cool over a weekend. On November 6th 2013, I got an email from my friend Ryan, asking if I wanted to contribute links to his new email list thingy called [Product Hunt](http://ryanhoover.me/post/66192199851/announcing-product-hunt)

## Product design
* [Principles of Product Design](http://bokardo.com/principles-of-product-design/) on [Bokardo](http://bokardo.com/) by [Joshua Porter](http://bokardo.com/about/)
* [Product](http://warpspire.com/posts/product/) (Jan 3, 2014) - Marc Andreessen was the first to coin the phrase: [software is eating the world](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460). And I tend to agree with him — no phrase defines our time more so than this one. More and more companies are powered by and create software. Yet I find myself wondering: what kind of software is eating the world? [..] We’ve become obsessed with process and tools. We’ve stopped caring about the product. Product is the reason that I build software. I want to create things that bring people joy. I want to build things I can be proud of. Things that makes the world a better place. *We can stop listening to the venture capitalists seeking a payout. We can stop listening to our colleagues who are driven by a desire for fame. We can build sustainable businesses that are not based on advertising and exploitation of other humans. We can care about building good product. We can care about the things that matter.*
* [Principles of User Interface Design](http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/) on [Bokardo](http://bokardo.com/) by [Joshua Porter](http://bokardo.com/about/)
* [Product Strategy Means Saying No](http://insideintercom.io/product-strategy-means-saying-no/)  
  If you’re building a product, you have to be great at saying no. Not “maybe” or “later”. The only word is no.
* [Build a Product with a High-Concept Problem](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/build-a-product-with-a-high-concept-problem-c6d405cb1e89)  
  In the world of books and movies, there is a term that agents and publishers and producers throw around a lot when they talk about which projects they’re going to invest in. Is it high-concept? Meaning, can the work be summarized in a way that people just “get” and find instantly appealing?  
  It’s not how your app works that needs to be high-concept, it’s what problem your app is trying to solve.  
  What problem is your product or service trying to solve? If you cannot describe it to someone else and have them instantly understand the pain/frustration/annoyance of this problem, then what you’re building is probably never going to get much traction.
* [Cognitive Overhead, Or Why Your Product Isn’t As Simple As You Think](http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/20/cognitive-overhead/) (Apr 20, 2013) by [David Lieb](http://twitter.com/dflieb), co-founder and CEO of [Bump](http://bu.mp/company)
  It’s been hard to ignore the massive shift in the last decade toward simple products. The rapid growth of mobile in the last five years has created an almost strict requirement for simple products that work on our new small screens and increasingly small attention spans. So why did this happen, and why mostly in the last 10 years? It’s only been in the last 10 years that technology products have reached the mass market. The market size of the entire broadband Internet in 2000 was 50 million people; today it is 2 billion people; in a few short years with the shift to mobile it will be more than 5 billion people. This mass market is comprised mostly of people who sit in the middle of the tech-adopter bell curve, and since they aren’t product designers, computer programmers, and tech bloggers, they require an even higher degree of simplicity.
* [Want to make a great product? An engineer isn’t enough](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2013/04/14/want-to-make-a-great-product-an-engineer-isnt-enough/) (Apr 14, 2013) by [Nick Kishfy](https://twitter.com/Kishfy), CEO of [MojoTech](http://www.mojotech.com/)
* [User Experience Debt](http://nform.com/blog/2013/05/user-experience-debt/) (May 7, 2013) by [Andrew Wright](https://twitter.com/andrewjwright)
* [Designing for real world mobile use](http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2013/may/24/mobile-design-real-world-use) (May 24, 2013) by [Luke Wroblewski](https://twitter.com/lukew), CEO and co-founder of [Input Factory Inc.](http://www.polarb.com/)
* [The importance of sketching in product](http://bokardo.com/archives/the-importance-of-sketching-in-product-design/) by [Joshua Porter](http://bokardo.com/about/) on [Bokardo](http://bokardo.com/)  
  The way to have product team members trust each other and get along is to have them sketch together.  
  There are a lot of hurdles to creating an effective product team. Perhaps the biggest hurdle of all is managing the relationships among the product team members and how those relationships affect the process they use to envision, design, and build the product they’re working on.
* [Why good storytelling helps you design great products](https://gigaom.com/2013/04/14/why-good-storytelling-helps-you-design-great-products/)  
  It’s not uncommon for designers to confuse a beautiful looking product with one that works beautifully. A great technique for creating smarter, better products is to approach them using story-centered design.
* [Is your product a Hafta or Wanna?](http://bokardo.com/archives/behavior-change-hafta-wanna/)  
  “Unfortunately, too many well-intentioned products fail because they feel like “haftas,” things people are obligated to do, as opposed to things they “wanna” do.  
  When faced with “haftas,” our brains register them as punishments so we take shortcuts, cheat, skip-out, or in the case of many apps or websites, uninstall them or click away in order to escape the discomfort of feeling controlled.
* [Why Behavior Change Apps Don’t Work](https://medium.com/behavior-design/why-behavior-change-apps-dont-work-1de726c2d7a4) by Nir Eyal  
Dr. Jesse Schell, of Carnegie Mellon’s Entertainment Technology Center, studies the psychology behind why people play, why people spend countless hours entranced playing Angry Birds or World of Warcraft while at the same time dreading doing other things, like their day jobs or filing taxes.  
  Schell said the difference comes down to whether the behavior is a “wanna” versus a “hafta.” The difference between things we want to do and things you have to do is, according to Schell, is “the difference between work and play … slavery and freedom … efficiency and pleasure.”  
[Nir Eyal](https://twitter.com/nireyal) is the author of [Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591847788/) and blogs about the psychology of products at [NirAndFar.com](http://nirandfar.com/).
* [Do people buy the drill or the hole?](https://medium.com/@tomgantzer/do-people-buy-the-drill-or-the-hole-7c2b6e1f54f0)  
  Working on a new drill might well lead to an improved hole, but what do our customers want their hole for? Too often we fall into the trap of “improving” our products, and not finding new ways to connect with real scenarios.  
  When people buy a power tool to drill a hole, they want to hang that family photo from Paris. They want extra storage space for converting their garage into a new business venture. They want to spend time with their dad hacking and modding a project car.  
  But why do people do these things? They want to smile, they want an easier life, and they want to bond.  
  Experience is the key word here.


## Behaviours
* [Your Job Is Not to Write Code](https://medium.com/@lauraklein/your-job-is-not-to-write-code-d002609b117a) - *I am lucky enough to work with a small team of fantastic engineers who truly care about their customers. If you are not that lucky, this letter is for you to share with your engineering team*. Your job is to improve our product for our users. If you want to get technical about it, your job is to improve our product for our users in a way that improves the key metrics of the company. But honestly, you don’t always have a lot of control over that second bit. You do, however, have an enormous amount of control over the first bit!


## Product Development
* [Two Product Principles Often Forgotten](https://blog.intercom.io/two-product-principles-often-forgotten/)
* [Four pricing principles to never forget](http://insideintercom.io/four-pricing-principals-to-never-forget/)  
  Most businesses are eventually faced with the key question: How much should we charge? There’s no one true answer. There are no gurus. There’s just you, your financials, and the need to make money.


## Product management
* [How to Be Startup CEO](startupguide.com/entrepreneurship/startup-ceo/) - Being the CEO of a startup is one of the most challenging roles out there. Your job is to build a product customers love; recruit a team; find funding from customers, partners, or investors; and guide the overall prioritization of work. In my experience the three most important components of the Start-up CEO’s role are: 1) Creating a product that solves a real customer need (and convincing customers to pay for it). 2) Making sure your users and customers have an extremely positive emotional experience with your product. 3) Recruiting a great team to build your product. Yes, you’re also in charge of incorporating, finding a place to work, creating the foundations of your culture, hiring your first employees, setting up a bank account, creating a web site, finding early stage funding, and taking out the trash. You’re basically the Chief Everything Officer at this early stage.


## Development Process
* [Developing Robust Deployment Procedures](http://24ways.org/2014/developing-robust-deployment-procedures/) - Once you have developed your site, how do you make it live on your web hosting? For many years the answer was to log on to your server and upload the files via FTP. Over time most hosts and FTP clients began to support SFTP, ensuring your files were transmitted over a secure connection. The process of deploying a site however remained the same.


## Retrospectives
* [The Rise and Fall of Everest (the App)](http://medium.stfi.re/@producthunt/the-rise-and-fall-of-everest-the-app-b0d2e6cb594c?sf=zoxpko#.51ibhbwo1) - Everest Co-founder Katherine Krug share the story about the rise and fall of the goal setting app. When the product launched in December 2012, Everest’s future was glaringly bright. The concept, design, and hype around the app strongly signaled its future success. But exactly two years later, in December 2014, Everest shuttered.


## Managing distributed teams

* [11 Tools That Allow us to Work from Anywhere on Earth as a Distributed Company](http://blog.ghost.org/distributed-team-tools/) - Open source, not-for-profit, and distributed. Sometimes I think we really are the black sheep of startups. As is becoming more and more common these days, Ghost is a fully distributed team. We have no office, no headquarters, and no fixed working hours. Our registered business address is a virtual office in central London. Nobody works there. Instead: We're all over the world.
