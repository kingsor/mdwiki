## Apps Ideas

### Webmarks App Project
[Webmarks](NextStepsProjects-Webmarks.md)


### Working with Firebase
* [Building an Android app with Google's Firebase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt75ZIGdJ4Y)
	* [Building a chat application with FirebaseUI for Android](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-Android/tree/0.3.1/codelabs/chat) - In this code lab you'll build a chat application for Android using Firebase and Android Studio.
* [Android Getting Started with Firebase – Login and Registration Authentication](http://www.androidhive.info/2016/06/android-getting-started-firebase-simple-login-registration-auth/) (Jun 2016) - Firebase provides a full set of authentication options out-of-the-box. Firebase automatically stores your users’ credentials securely (using bcrypt) and redundantly (with replication and daily off-site backups). This separates sensitive user credentials from your application data, and lets you focus on the user interface and experience for your app.
* [Android Login and Registration with PHP, MySQL and SQLite](http://www.androidhive.info/2012/01/android-login-and-registration-with-php-mysql-and-sqlite/) (Jan 2012) - I like it for the Login and Register activities.
* [Firebase Tutorial: Getting Started](https://www.raywenderlich.com/139322/firebase-tutorial-getting-started-2) (Sep 19, 2016) - in this Firebase tutorial, you’ll learn all the fundamentals of Firebase by making a collaborative grocery list app called Grocr. When items get added to the list they’ll appear instantly on any user’s devices, but you’re not going to stop there. You’ll tweak Grocr to work offline, so the list stays in sync even with a spotty grocery store data connection.


### Notes App
* [Building a Google Keep Clone with Vue and Firebase, Pt 1](https://scotch.io/tutorials/building-a-google-keep-clone-with-vue-and-firebase-pt-1) by [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/) - In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a (minimal) Google Keep clone app with the Model-View-Viewmodel (MVVM) framework Vue and Firebase as a backend.

This is still experimental, so I'd love to hear any suggestion / improvements to the approach!

Here we look at what we can do with it and how to use this new API to manage our beacons. To really understand how the API works, I decided to build a sample app, allowing me to really test the API’s functionality. Android users can find this on github: [itherejoe/WatchTower](https://github.com/hitherejoe/WatchTower) 
* [Droidcon 2015 - Experimenting monitoring and proximity techniques using Android - Matteo Gazzurelli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DQ5Ng_nE8E) - the speech describes the demo project with the implementation of the Monitoring and Ranging Features of iBeacons.
