* [The Complete Guide to Google Interview Preparation](http://blog.gainlo.co/index.php/category/google-interview-preparation/) - Therefore, this resource contains everything you need to know about Google interview preparation with tactile, immediately actionable things that you can do right after reading the post. If you are looking for a software engineer position in top companies like Google, Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, etc., this is for you. Google undoubtedly has the most standard interview process and most tech companies have borrowed similar ideas. As a result, this guide is applicable for most top companies like Facebook, Uber, Dropbox, Amazon, Airbnb and so on so forth. Of course, different companies have its own focuses like culture fit. But the most important and basic requirements like data structures/algorithms and system design are same everywhere (though the bar might be different). Some small startups might have a completely unique interview process, which won’t be covered in this resource. For example, some companies will ask the candidate to finish a project over the weekend. I would suggest reading the whole thing! To save you time, I’ve tried my best to put everything into immediately actionable things so that you’ll know exactly what to work on.
* [15 Java Enum Interview Questions for Developers with Answers](http://www.java67.com/2013/07/15-java-enum-interview-questions-amswers-for-experienced-programmers.html) (Jul 15, 2013) - Enum was introduced in Java 5 and since then it's been very popular among Java developers and widely used in different Java applications. Since Enum in Java is much more versatile than Enum in C or C++, it also presents lots of interesting use cases. But, despite being so popular, many Java programmer are still not aware of functionality provided by Enum and subtle details of using Enum in Java code. This motivates me to put together a list of frequently asked question in Java Enum, which not only helps to do well in Interviews, but also open new path for learning.
