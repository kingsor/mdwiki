](https://twitter.com/matthiaslange) - Many people think of FinTech as a new hip trend. The reality, however, is that FinTech is maturing. The times when FinTech was only a fancy app are over, making it much more than just a nice customer frontend. Consequently, business models in the FinTech industry are moving away from the (retail) consumer interface towards innovation that includes the backend and solutions that are focused on corporate customers.

## Apache Kafka
* [Apache Kafka - Quick Guide](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/apache_kafka/apache_kafka_quick_guide.htm) - Kafka is designed for distributed high throughput systems. Kafka tends to work very well as a replacement for a more traditional message broker. In comparison to other messaging systems, Kafka has better throughput, built-in partitioning, replication and inherent fault-tolerance, which makes it a good fit for large-scale message processing applications.
* [Apache Kafka, Data Pipelines, and Functional Reactive Programming with Node.js](https://blog.heroku.com/kafka-data-pipelines-frp-node) (Nov 29, 2016) - Heroku recently released a managed Apache Kafka offering. As a Node.js developer, I wanted to demystify Kafka by sharing a simple yet practical use case with the many Node.js developers who are curious how this technology might be useful. I wanted a data source that was simple to explain to others and from which I could get a high rate of message throughput, so I chose to use data from the Twitter Stream API, as keyword-defined tweet streams fit these needs perfectly. Fast, reliable, and scalable.
* [How-to: Do Real-Time Log Analytics with Apache Kafka, Cloudera Search, and Hue](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2015/02/how-to-do-real-time-log-analytics-with-apache-kafka-cloudera-search-and-hue/) (Feb 27, 2015) - If you are not looking at your company’s operational logs, then you are at a competitive disadvantage in your industry. Web server logs, application logs, and system logs are all valuable sources of operational intelligence, uncovering potential revenue opportunities and helping drive down the bottom line.
* [Apache Kafka on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/kafka-on-heroku) (Dec 22, 2016) - Apache Kafka on Heroku is an add-on that provides Kafka as a service with full integration into the Heroku platform. Apache Kafka is a distributed commit log for fast, fault-tolerant communication between producers and consumers using message based topics. Kafka provides the messaging backbone for building a new generation of distributed applications capable of handling billions of events and millions of transactions, and is designed to move large volumes of ephemeral data with a high degree of reliability and fault tolerance.
* [Apache Kafka - Use cases](https://kafka.apache.org/uses) - Here is a description of a few of the popular use cases for Apache Kafka™. For an overview of a number of these areas in action, see [this blog post](http://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying).
* [Apache Kafka: an Essential Overview](https://anturis.com/blog/apache-kafka-an-essential-overview/) (Sep 22, 2015) - To use an old term to describe something relatively new, Apache Kafka is messaging middleware. It is designed to send data from one server to another in a fault-tolerant, high-capacity way and, depending on the configuration, verify the receipt of sent data. In performance tests it has been shown to be able to do two million writes per second. In addition to being software, Kafka is also a protocol, like TCP. In other words, it operates at the transport layer of the OSI model. You can think of it as an extremely high-capacity syslog. Kafka was written by LinkedIn and is now an open source Apache product. They wrote it in Scala. LinkedIn and other companies use Kafka to read data feeds and organize them into topics.
* [heroku-kafka-demo-nodejs](https://github.com/apiaryio/heroku-kafka-demo-nodejs) - A simple heroku app that demonstrates using Kafka in NodeJS. This demo app accepts HTTP POST requests and writes them to a topic, and has a simple page that shows the last 10 messages produced to that topic.

### Java Topics
* [Java static methods can be a code smell](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2012/05/java-static-methods-can-be-code-smell.html) - In Java, static methods allow you to execute code at a “class scope” as opposed to an instance scope like member methods. This means, they rely on class-level variables (if any), parameters passed to the static method, or any other globally accessible data. They are NOT object oriented. An object has state associated with it and can be manipulated only through methods that implement the object’s “behavior.” Static methods do not operate on state, they are not object oriented, and in fact they are procedural.
* [Java Generics Tutorial – Example Class, Interface, Methods, Wildcards and much more](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2013/07/java-generics-tutorial-example-class-interface-methods-wildcards-and-much-more.html) - Generics is one of the core feature of Java programming and it was introduced in Java 5. If you have been working on Java Collections and with version 5 or higher, I am sure that you have used it. Using generics with collection classes is very easy but it provides a lot more features than just creating the type of collection and we will try to learn features of generics in this article. Understanding generics can become confusing sometimes if we go with jargon words, so I would try to keep it simple and easy to understand.
* [Java Annotations Tutorial – The ULTIMATE Guide](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2014/11/java-annotations-tutorial.html) - Annotations in Java are a major feature and every Java developer should know how to utilize them.

### Java Multithreading
* [Java Concurrency / Multithreading Tutorial](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/)
* [Creating and Starting Java Threads](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/creating-and-starting-threads.html) - Java threads are objects like any other Java objects. Threads are instances of class java.lang.Thread, or instances of subclasses of this class. In addition to being objects, java threads can also execute code.
* [Race Conditions and Critical Sections](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/race-conditions-and-critical-sections.html) - A race condition is a special condition that may occur inside a critical section. A critical section is a section of code that is executed by multiple threads and where the sequence of execution for the threads makes a difference in the result of the concurrent execution of the critical section.
* [Java Synchronized Blocks](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/synchronized.html) - A Java synchronized block marks a method or a block of code as synchronized. Java synchronized blocks can be used to avoid [race conditions](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/race-conditions-and-critical-sections.html).
* [Multithreading and Concurrency Interview Questions and Answers – The ULTIMATE List](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2014/11/multithreading-concurrency-interview-questions-answers.html) - Concurrency is always a challenge for developers and writing concurrent programs can be extremely hard. There is a number of things that could potentially blow up and the complexity of systems rises considerably when concurrency is introduced. However, the ability to write robust concurrent programs is a great tool in a developer’s belt and can help build sophisticated, enterprise level applications. In this article we will discuss different types of questions that can be used in a programming interview in order to assess a candidate’s understanding of concurrency and multithreading. The questions are not only Java specific, but revolve around general programming principles. Enjoy!
