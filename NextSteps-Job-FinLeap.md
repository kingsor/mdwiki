* [The next FinTech Chapter - current observations on the FinTech market](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/next-fintech-chapter-current-observations-market-matthias-lange) (Feb 19, 2017) by [Matthias Lange
](https://twitter.com/matthiaslange) - Many people think of FinTech as a new hip trend. The reality, however, is that FinTech is maturing. The times when FinTech was only a fancy app are over, making it much more than just a nice customer frontend. Consequently, business models in the FinTech industry are moving away from the (retail) consumer interface towards innovation that includes the backend and solutions that are focused on corporate customers.

### Java Topics
* [Java static methods can be a code smell](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2012/05/java-static-methods-can-be-code-smell.html) - In Java, static methods allow you to execute code at a “class scope” as opposed to an instance scope like member methods. This means, they rely on class-level variables (if any), parameters passed to the static method, or any other globally accessible data. They are NOT object oriented. An object has state associated with it and can be manipulated only through methods that implement the object’s “behavior.” Static methods do not operate on state, they are not object oriented, and in fact they are procedural.
* [Java Generics Tutorial – Example Class, Interface, Methods, Wildcards and much more](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2013/07/java-generics-tutorial-example-class-interface-methods-wildcards-and-much-more.html) - Generics is one of the core feature of Java programming and it was introduced in Java 5. If you have been working on Java Collections and with version 5 or higher, I am sure that you have used it. Using generics with collection classes is very easy but it provides a lot more features than just creating the type of collection and we will try to learn features of generics in this article. Understanding generics can become confusing sometimes if we go with jargon words, so I would try to keep it simple and easy to understand.

### Java Multithreading
* [Java Concurrency / Multithreading Tutorial](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/)
* [Creating and Starting Java Threads](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/creating-and-starting-threads.html) - Java threads are objects like any other Java objects. Threads are instances of class java.lang.Thread, or instances of subclasses of this class. In addition to being objects, java threads can also execute code.
* [Race Conditions and Critical Sections](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/race-conditions-and-critical-sections.html) - A race condition is a special condition that may occur inside a critical section. A critical section is a section of code that is executed by multiple threads and where the sequence of execution for the threads makes a difference in the result of the concurrent execution of the critical section.
* [Java Synchronized Blocks](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/synchronized.html) - A Java synchronized block marks a method or a block of code as synchronized. Java synchronized blocks can be used to avoid [race conditions](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/race-conditions-and-critical-sections.html).
* [Multithreading and Concurrency Interview Questions and Answers – The ULTIMATE List](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2014/11/multithreading-concurrency-interview-questions-answers.html) - Concurrency is always a challenge for developers and writing concurrent programs can be extremely hard. There is a number of things that could potentially blow up and the complexity of systems rises considerably when concurrency is introduced. However, the ability to write robust concurrent programs is a great tool in a developer’s belt and can help build sophisticated, enterprise level applications. In this article we will discuss different types of questions that can be used in a programming interview in order to assess a candidate’s understanding of concurrency and multithreading.
