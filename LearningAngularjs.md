# Getting started with AngularJs

## Sample code

* [Revisiting last year's AnguarJS feed reader](http://davidandsuzi.com/revisiting-last-years-angularjs-feed-reader/)
* [FreedReadR: RSS Reader Created With AngularJS (part 1 of 2)](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/817417/FreedReadR-RSS-Reader-Created-With-AngularJS-part)  [(part 2 of 2)](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/820771/FreedReadR-RSS-Reader-Created-With-AngularJS-par)  
	This is the second part of a two part article.  The first article stored all data in localStorage and that made it so only the one browser you originally used was able to retrieve your list of feeds.   
	Now, with the changes in this article you will be able to sign in using your social account (Facebook, Google, Yahoo) and save your feed list to your own personal account.
