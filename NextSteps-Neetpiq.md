## Freelancing
* [HOW TO MOVE FROM FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT TO FULL TIME FREELANCING?](http://www.michaelhoughton.com/article/how-to-move-from-full-time-employment-to-full-time-freelancing) (Dec 12, 2016) - I have been freelancing full time for the majority of my 12 year career. Freelancing was something I had always dreamt about doing - I wanted to be my own boss and run my own business - and freelancing has allowed me to do just that! More importantly it gives me the freedom to choose the types of projects to work on and be selective about the clients I work with. The aim of this article is to help clarify the steps which a Developer needs to take to break into freelancing.
* [HOW I FREELANCE? ATTRIBUTES REQUIRED FOR FULL TIME FREELANCING](http://www.michaelhoughton.com/article/how-i-freelance-attributes-required-for-full-time-freelancing) (Nov 10, 2016) - After 6 months on the Toptal core team, I recently went back into full time freelancing - doing PHP development. My experience on the Toptal core team was amazing, however I missed the freelancing lifestyle and found working around meetings and schedules at times very stressful. While being a freelancer does comes with risks and certainly isn't for everyone - I would love to take the time to highlight what I love about freelancing and how I like to work!

  Many teams have already migrated to git and many more are transitioning to it now. Apart from training single developers and appointing Champions to help with the adoption it is imperative to pick a nice and simple code collaboration practice that does not complicate things too much. With git one can definitely conjure very complicated workflows, I’ve seen them first hand.
* [Git Workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows)  
  The array of possible workflows can make it hard to know where to begin when implementing Git in the workplace. This page provides a starting point by surveying the most common Git workflows for enterprise teams.


## Open Source Contribution

Starting from this Meetup Group:

## Working remotely
* [7 Remote Work Trends to take into consideration in 2017](http://remoters.net/remote-work-trends-2017)
* [How to work Remotely with 150+ people](https://medium.com/@jobv/how-to-work-remotely-with-150-people-89741118418c) (Jan 3, 2016) - Work asynchronously, keep a single source of truth, avoid management overhead and communicate.
* [Working Remotely at GitLab: An update](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/03/04/remote-working-gitlab/) (Mar 4, 2016) - In April 2015, we published the Remote Manifesto on our blog. There were 9 people in the company at that time, which means we've grown over 600% during that time, with 54 people on our team as I write this.
* [How to Remote](https://dev.to/andydangerous/how-to-remote) (Feb 15, 2017) - Working with a remote team has many advantages. It can also be hard to do effectively. This post is how to remote. As for why, maybe I'll cover that in the future.
* [How to Find and Get Hired for a Remote Job](https://zapier.com/blog/remote-work-jobs/) (Jan 31, 2017) - For many people, remote work is the ideal way to work. You get the income stability and benefits of being an employee, plus the freedom to work wherever fits you best. You get to ditch the soul-crushing commute and, yes, work in your pajamas if you like. Before you throw out all your suits, though, you have to land the job. Here at Zapier, we're a 100% remote team and we get many applicants for our job openings. In our Customer Champion roles, for example, only 2% of applicants get a job fit interview and only 0.4% are hired. We're as picky as Yale–and so are other employers.


## Startup Europe
* [EU-Startups](http://www.eu-startups.com/) - it is one of the leading startup blogs in Europe and was founded in October of 2010. We write about internet and tech startups out of Europe and provide our readers with data-driven analysis, interviews and startup-related news. In addition to our focus on young technology companies, we also publish other kinds of news out of the tech-space that has a commercial or cultural impact on startups in Europe.


## Resume
* [JSON Resume](http://jsonresume.org/)  
  JSON Resume is a community driven open source initiative to create a JSON based standard for resumes. There is no reason why there can't be a common standard for writing a resume that can be extended with an ecosystem of open source tools. 
  * [On Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7996464)
* [Example CV JSON](https://gist.github.com/mcrider/3925110)

## Interview Questions

* [Whiteboarding](https://writing.pupius.co.uk/whiteboarding-4df873dbba2e) (Nov 20, 2012) - If you are interviewing for a programming job it is almost inevitable that you will be asked to do some coding on a whiteboard. In this post I’m not commenting on the validity of this style of interview (though I do personally find whiteboard coding a useful way to see how candidates work through problems) but instead pointing out some common pitfalls that can be avoided, given that this is how tech companies interview.


### Java
* [20 Java Interview Questions from Investment Banks (Answered)](http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/1061616/Java-Interview-Questions-from-Investment-Banks-Ans) - Some core Java questions from Interviews from Investment banks, good for technical round.

There’s no email, no office, no set work hours, no vacation policy, and seemingly little in the way of structure.
* [How To Go Remote](http://workdifferent.com/how-to-remote/) - Too often, the idea of running a distributed (remote) team is dismissed as only possible when the company is small. This week, Automattic showed us that it’s not only possible to have a fully distributed team at a large scale, but you become a billion dollar company doing it. In this HowToWD we are going to disassemble the learnings from Automattic into a format that can be easily implemented by any team.

This overview serves two purposes. At first, the structure gives you in one view an overview, which posts are already written and how you can find them. At second, I give you an outline of all posts, which will be written. I will successively refine the outline to make the future of this post transparent. This purpose is a more challenging task for me.
* [Multithreading with C++17 and C++20](http://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/multithreading-in-c-17-and-c-20) - Forecasts about the future are difficult. In particular, when they are about C++20.

* [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) - The NVIDIA® CUDA® Toolkit provides a comprehensive development environment for C and C++ developers building GPU-accelerated applications. The CUDA Toolkit includes a compiler for NVIDIA GPUs, math libraries, and tools for debugging and optimizing the performance of your applications. You’ll also find programming guides, user manuals, API reference, and other documentation to help you get started quickly accelerating your application with GPUs.
