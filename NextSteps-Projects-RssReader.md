# Rss Reader

## Feed Reader
A source of articles to pick up from.


### Foreword
* [RSS: there's nothing better](https://davidyat.es/2017/05/18/rss-nothing-better/)
* [Why RSS Still Beats Facebook and Twitter for Tracking News](https://fieldguide.gizmodo.com/why-rss-feeds-still-beat-facebook-and-twitter-for-track-1800722740)
* [The power of the RSS reader](http://www.marco.org/2013/03/26/power-of-rss)  
  RSS is best for following a large number of infrequently updated sites: sites that you’d never remember to check every day because they only post occasionally, and that your social-network friends won’t reliably find or link to.

### What's out there
* [Add News to Your Website - News Widgets, Twitter Widgets, RSS Widgets](http://www.blastcasta.com/add-news-to-your-website.aspx) by [BlastCasta](http://www.blastcasta.com/) - You can easily make your RSS feeds available to others to pull and render into their websites using our tool, and as you know, these feeds can link back to your site.
* [WebApp: FeedBlendr](http://dentedreality.com.au/projects/feedblendr/)  
  There are a lot of tools available for doing things with information that’s presented in standard feed format (RSS or Atom usually). FeedBlendr was created to give you a simple way to blend multiple source feeds into a single, combined feed. Then you could take that feed and use it in any of the other tools out there.
