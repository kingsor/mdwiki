## Resume
* [JSON Resume](http://jsonresume.org/)  
  JSON Resume is a community driven open source initiative to create a JSON based standard for resumes. There is no reason why there can't be a common standard for writing a resume that can be extended with an ecosystem of open source tools.

## Inspiring Products

* [CosmosBrowserAndroid](https://github.com/ColdSauce/CosmosBrowserAndroid)  
  Cosmos Browser allows the user to connect to the internet through the use of SMS. No data or WiFi required.
* [CosmosBrowserBackend](https://github.com/Rohfosho/CosmosBrowserBackend)  
  After a person inputs a url, our app texts our Twilio number which forwards the URL as a POST request to our Node.JS backend. The backend takes the url, gets the HTML source of the website, minifies it, gets rid of the css, javascript, and images, GZIP compresses it, encodes it in Base64, and sends the data as a series of SMSes. The phone recieves this stream at a rate of 3 messages per second, orders them, decompresses them, and displays the content.

## WPF

* [Using Checkbox in Combo Box](http://zamjad.wordpress.com/2009/11/30/using-checkbox-in-combo-box/)  
  Using checkbox in combo box is very much similar to using any other control. Here we are going to use data template to define the visual tree of each and individual items of the combo box.
* [How to automatically open/close the DropDown-portion of a ComboBox when the mouse enters/leaves the control](http://www.blogs.intuidev.com/post/2011/01/02/combobox_autoopendropdown_attachedbehavior.aspx)  
  Today, I came about a thread where the poster was asking for a way to automatically open a ComboBox'es DropDown/popup when the mouse hovers over the ComboBox.
* [WPF DataGrid as ComboBox Dropdown](http://www.nullskull.com/a/1359/wpf-datagrid-as-combobox-dropdown.aspx)  
  This article describes how to display the items of a WPF ComboBox inside a DataGrid when the ComboBox is clicked. It also shows how to make the behavior same as that of a normal ComboBox, like clicking the item on the DataGrid should close the ComboBox's popup.
* [WPF Datagrid as ComboBox Dropdown Part 2](http://www.nullskull.com/a/1428/wpf-datagrid-as-combobox-dropdown-part-2.aspx)  
  This presents a WPF custom control derived from ComboBox that shows a DataGrid to display the ComboBox items.
* [WPF Tutorial.net](http://www.wpftutorial.net/)  
  Welcome to my website about the Windows Presentation Foundation. The tutorials will show you how to create the next generation user experience. I hope you will get amazed by the possibilities of this fascinating technology.
* [A couple of tricks when using the standard WPF .NET 4.0 DatePicker control](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/126762/A-couple-of-tricks-when-using-the-standard-WPF-NET)  
  So what does the attached code actually do? Well, it is dead simple; it shows you how to modify the standard .NET 4.0 WPF DatePicker control to allow the user to use the keyboard up/down keys to skip days/months/years when the mouse is in the correct portions of the DatePicker text, which is something the standard control does not actually do.

* [WPF Prevent an item being selectect in combobox when hovered](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/71961aa9-d98c-4944-a337-cb2d8eca69ba/wpf-prevent-an-item-being-selectect-in-combobox-when-hovered?forum=wpf)
* [WPF: Customizing ComboBox ](http://www.howdoicode.net/2012/07/wpf-customizing-combobox.html)  
  Problem statement: We need to customize the Combo Box's template by adding an 'Add' button as one of the items in the list.
* [Is WPF dead: the present and future of WPF](http://pragmateek.com/is-wpf-dead-the-present-and-future-of-wpf/)  
  As developers we don’t want to have technical skills nobody needs, and instead we generally must build a large enough portfolio of skills to accommodate the more businesses and projects we can to reduce the risk of being left behind.  
  Another good point for WPF is the fact businesses and individuals don’t migrate immediately to each brand new OS version, and for a lot of good reasons: it costs money, it takes some time, it’s risky, and often it’s simply useless.  
  Currently (mid-2014) the market shares of WinRT on the PC market are quite reduced:
o Windows 8 + 8.1 : ~15%
o Windows 7 : ~55%
o Windows Vista : ~5%
o Windows XP : ~25%
So for more than 80% of PCs you can’t use WinRT and have no other choice than WPF.
And in some context this is worst for Windows 8+: in the companies I know in the financial sector in France this is simply 0%, the migration to Windows 7 is not even completed everywhere, and I know some still running with Windows XP because setup of applications is not trivial.
Considering the renewal cycle is about 5 years WPF should be the unique choice for a lot of businesses till the end of the decades.
* [Snoop](http://snoopwpf.codeplex.com/)  
  Snoop is the open source WPF spying utility created by Pete Blois and now maintained by Team Snoop (Cory Plotts, Dan Hanan, Andrei Kashcha, Maciek Rakowski, and Jason Jibben).  
  It allows you to spy/browse the visual tree of a running WPF application (without the need for a debugger) … and change properties ... amongst other things.

## 3D Printing

* [RepRap](http://reprap.org/)  
  RepRap takes the form of a free desktop 3D printer capable of printing plastic objects. Since many parts of RepRap are made from plastic and RepRap prints those parts, RepRap self-replicates by making a kit of itself - a kit that anyone can assemble given time and materials. It also means that - if you've got a RepRap - you can print lots of useful stuff, and you can print another RepRap for a friend... 
* [Eventorbot](http://www.reprap.org/wiki/Eventorbot)  
  The Mission and challenge behind Eventorbot, was to build a rigid, low cost 3d printer. Using less parts, easy to assemble, and is capable to self replicate most of its parts. It is 100% open source project, and all plans are available for anyone interested. Since 80% of the Eventorbots parts are printable. Once you build your first machine, you can make it even more affordable for friends, family, or the community. With the single solid steel frame, it eliminates 40% of parts and cost that other 3d printers uses for a housing and structure. Making it easier and more affordable for anyone to own a 3d Printer ("Lets just start printing our own stuff").

* [The importance of sketching in product](http://bokardo.com/archives/the-importance-of-sketching-in-product-design/) by [Joshua Porter](http://bokardo.com/about/) on [Bokardo](http://bokardo.com/)  
  The way to have product team members trust each other and get along is to have them sketch together.  
  There are a lot of hurdles to creating an effective product team. Perhaps the biggest hurdle of all is managing the relationships among the product team members and how those relationships affect the process they use to envision, design, and build the product they’re working on.
* [Why good storytelling helps you design great products](https://gigaom.com/2013/04/14/why-good-storytelling-helps-you-design-great-products/)

    * [Why Behavior Change Apps Don’t Work](https://medium.com/behavior-design/why-behavior-change-apps-dont-work-1de726c2d7a4) by Nir Eyal  
  Dr. Jesse Schell, of Carnegie Mellon’s Entertainment Technology Center, studies the psychology behind why people play, why people spend countless hours entranced playing Angry Birds or World of Warcraft while at the same time dreading doing other things, like their day jobs or filing taxes.  
  Schell said the difference comes down to whether the behavior is a “wanna” versus a “hafta.” The difference between things we want to do and things you have to do is, according to Schell, is “the difference between work and play … slavery and freedom … efficiency and pleasure.”  
  Nir Eyal is the author of [Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591847788/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1591847788&linkCode=as2&tag=syndicatedcontent-20&linkId=WQOSMJ6WXVLOEEOT) and blogs about the psychology of products at [NirAndFar.com](http://nirandfar.com/).

Non erano qui per risparmiare, erano qui per vincere; gli oggetti erano una scusa.  
  [..] Hanno comprato qualcosa di cui non hanno bisogno a un prezzo talvolta eccessivo, eppure sorridono: l'hanno strappato a qualcun altro, ed è questo ciò che conta.

  This post is simply here to remind some of you why we do what we do. A message that often gets lost,
in this world of funding-hungry startups.  
  8 months ago I started my company. And I never took a cent of outside funding.  
  Here's why I think self-funding (also known as bootstrapping) is the best thing a young startup can do.
* [15 Reasons to Keep Your Company Small](http://readwrite.com/2014/05/05/keep-your-startup-small)

  Many teams have already migrated to git and many more are transitioning to it now. Apart from training single developers and appointing Champions to help with the adoption it is imperative to pick a nice and simple code collaboration practice that does not complicate things too much. With git one can definitely conjure very complicated workflows, I’ve seen them first hand.

## Web APIs (REST and more)

* [The Web API checklist - 43 things to think about](https://mathieu.fenniak.net/the-api-checklist/) (Apr 15, 2014)  
  When you’re designing, testing, or releasing a new Web API, you’re building a new system on top of an existing complex and sophisticated system. At a minimum, you’re building upon HTTP, which is built upon TCP/IP, which is built upon a series of tubes. You’re also building upon a web server, an application framework, and maybe an API framework.  
  Most people, myself included, are not aware of all the intricacies and nuances of every component they’re building upon. Even if you deeply understand each component, it’s probably going to be too much information to hold in your head at one time.
* [Best Practices for Designing a Pragmatic RESTful API](http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api)  
  Your data model has started to stabilize and you're in a position to create a public API for your web app. You realize it's hard to make significant changes to your API once it's released and want to get as much right as possible up front. Now, the internet has no shortage on opinions on API design. But, since there's no one widely adopted standard that works in all cases, you're left with a bunch of choices: What formats should you accept? How should you authenticate? Should your API be versioned?  
  In designing an API for SupportFu (a Zendesk Alternative), I've tried to come up with pragmatic answers to these questions. My goal is for the SupportFu API to be easy to use, easy to adopt and flexible enough to dogfood for our own user interfaces.
* [Swagger aims to become the de facto standard for APIs](http://m.infoworld.com/t/web-services/swagger-aims-become-the-de-facto-standard-apis-250196)  
  The popular open source [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) API framework, intended to make it easier to deploy and use APIs, advanced this week with the release of [version 2.0](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec).  
Swagger's update focuses on evolving its JSON syntax, providing a human-friendly authoring format, and creating mechanisms for vendor extensions. Version 2.0 also features a Swagger editor and validation tools.
	* [Building Enterprise APIs with StrongLoop Support for Swagger 2.0 ](http://strongloop.com/strongblog/enterprise-api-swagger-2-0-loopback/)  
  The Swagger 2.0 specification was officially released today and at StrongLoop we are excited to announce that LoopBack is the first Node.js framework to support Swagger 2.0. Using LoopBack you can now take a Swagger 1.2 or 2.0 specification and automatically scaffold a Node-powered REST API. This should be especially useful for any developer wanting to easily describe their APIs using the leading enterprise standard for API specification and implement them in Node.js. Developers now have the ultimate flexibility in starting from a “bottoms up” approach – building APIs from existing data sources or a “top down” approach – starting with the leading enterprise API specification and scaffolding up a backend of generated models.

* [Cities of You](http://citiesofyou.com/)  
  Cities of You is a project that envisions people as imaginary places. Inspired by Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities, I travel through each city and describe their special properties- how the buildings are built, how the people live, its history, culture, and reputation. As the project progresses, I revisit some cities, describing how they evolve over time or enter unexplored parts of the cities. The intended result is to be able to imagine relationships as dynamic spaces in which one can visit, walk through, and explore. -- Brian Foo

## Open source projects

* [Google I/O App](https://github.com/google/iosched)  
  The source code for the 2014 version of the Google I/O app is now available. Since its first release on Google Play a few weeks before the conference, the I/O app was downloaded by hundreds of thousands of people, including on-site attendees, I/O Extended event participants and users tuning in from home. If one of the goals of the app is to be useful to conference attendees, the other primary goal is to serve as a practical example of best practices for Android app design and development.  
  In addition to showing how to implement a wide variety of features that are useful for most Android apps, such as Fragments, Loaders, Services, Broadcast Receivers, alarms, notifications, SQLite databases, Content Providers, Action Bar and the Navigation Drawer, the I/O app source code also shows how to integrate with several Google products and services, from the [Google Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive/) to [Google Cloud Messaging](http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html). It uses the [material design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) approach, the [Android L Preview APIs](http://developer.android.com/preview/index.html) and full [Android Wear](http://developer.android.com/wear/index.html) integration with a packaged wearable app for sending session feedback.

  If you haven't seen Philm yet, it is a movie collection and information app that I created for Android. It uses the Trakt and TMDB APIs.  
This morning I pushed the source of Philm to [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisbanes/philm) under the Apache v2.0 licence.  
This does not mean that I have stopped development, it's just got to the point where I'm happy with it so can share the source.  
Philm has been a bit of an experiment as it uses a type of MVC-type architecture to split out UI, business and model code, something that has not really be explored (publicly) in Android development.

## Minimum Viable Stack

Reading [How to build your Minimum Viable Stack](https://medium.com/design-startups/7dcb59c9fe1f) I was thinking about what can be a Minimum Viable Stack for me.
Something similar to what described in this article [Creating a REST Server for a CRUD Web Application from a very Light Stack](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/680119/Creating-a-REST-Server-for-a-CRUD-Web-Application) that is a solution that fits well with my knowledge.
It is based on the following components:

* [NancyFx](http://nancyfx.org/) - Lightweight, low-ceremony, framework for building HTTP based services on .Net and Mono  
  Available as package on [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Nancy/) and as source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy)
* [PetaPoco](http://www.toptensoftware.com/petapoco/) - PetaPoco is a tiny, fast, single-file micro-ORM for .NET and Mono. It works with SQL Server, SQL Server CE, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle. Available as package on [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/packages/PetaPoco) and as source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/toptensoftware/petapoco).
* [System.Data.SQLite](http://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki) - It is an ADO.NET adapter for [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/).  
  Available as package on [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SQLite/).

Some stuff about PetaPoco

* [How to use Dapper & PetaPoco, Micro ORMs](http://stevenhollidge.blogspot.de/2011/04/how-to-use-dapper-petapoco-micro-orms.html) - Dapper (Dynamic Query Mapper) and PetaPoco are Mirco ORMs.  An ORM is an Object Relational Mapper which sit between your business logic and database to abstract away the direct link between the two.  Micro ORMs are a simplier and more efficient option to larger ORM frameworks such as EF4 and NHibernate.
* [.NET Micro-ORMs - Dapper, PetaPoco, and more](http://www.nullskull.com/a/1659/net-microorms--dapper-petapoco-and-more.aspx) - Enter the Micro-ORM. These provide the esssence of what developers want - an easy way to map Database operations to strongly typed classes. LINQ support in some makes it even better. But the main advantage of some of these Micro-ORMs is raw speed. They don't offer all the bells and whistles of the Entity Framework or NHibernate, but in many cases, you don't need all this glop anyway. You simply want to be able to do CRUD and work with objects instead of DataReaders.
* [PetaPoco – Why I’m Using A Micro-ORM](http://schotime.net/blog/index.php/2011/05/04/petapoco-why-im-using-a-micro-orm/) - I had been using my own SQL to Object mapper for a while before I stumbled over PetaPoco, and it had very similar ideas to mine. It has gone one step further though, with nice support for paging, inserts, updates, deletes and multiple database support. 
* [Getting Started PetaPoco: Create POCO and perform CRUD](http://www.emadmokhtar.com/2012/05/getting-started-petapoco-create-poco-and-perform-crud/) by [Emad Mokhtar](http://www.emadmokhtar.com/aboutme) - In this post we’ll learn How to create one POCO and perform CRUD on it, I’ll use the famous Northwind database and create POCO for Customers table, let’s see how we can do it.

## About Retrospective

* Actions following [SMART criteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)
  The November 1981 issue of Management Review contained a paper by George T. Doran called *There's a S.M.A.R.T. way to write management's goals and objectives*. It discussed the importance of objectives and the difficulty in setting them.

  Ideally speaking, each corporate, department, and section objective should be:
  - Specific: target a specific area for improvement.
  - Measurable: quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.
  - Assignable: specify who will do it.
  - Realistic: state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.
  - Time-related: specify when the result(s) can be achieved.

    Notice that these criteria don't say that all objectives must be quantified on all levels of management. In certain situations it is not realistic to attempt quantification, particularly in staff middle-management positions. Practicing managers and corporations can lose the benefit of a more abstract objective in order to gain quantification. It is the combination of the objective and its action plan that is really important. Therefore, serious management should focus on these twins and not just the objective.
