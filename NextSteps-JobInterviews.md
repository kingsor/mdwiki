# Preparing a Job Interview
Or what you need to know to be a good developer.

## General
* [Whiteboarding](https://writing.pupius.co.uk/whiteboarding-4df873dbba2e) (Nov 20, 2012) - If you are interviewing for a programming job it is almost inevitable that you will be asked to do some coding on a whiteboard. In this post I’m not commenting on the validity of this style of interview (though I do personally find whiteboard coding a useful way to see how candidates work through problems) but instead pointing out some common pitfalls that can be avoided, given that this is how tech companies interview.
* [97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Contributions_Appearing_in_the_Book) - The collection is intended simply to contain multiple and varied perspectives on what it is that contributors to the project feel programmers should know. This can be anything from code-focused advice to culture, from algorithm usage to agile thinking, from implementation know-how to professionalism, from style to substance.
* [The Joel Test For Programmers (The Simple Programmer Test)](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2015/02/16/joel-test-programmers-simple-programmer-test/) (Feb 16, 2015) - The Joel Test is great for software development shops and for programmers that are interested in quickly evaluating a company's software development environment, but what about a Joel Test for actual programmers? Several people have asked me lately if I had an idea for a Joel Test to evaluate an actual programmer, rather than a software development organization, so I've decided to put together a list of what I think might be a good equivalent of the Joel Test for evaluating the skills of an actual software developer.
* [Interview Questions & Answers](https://biginterview.com/blog/interview-questions-answers) - Knowing how to put together a strong answer to the most common interview questions is obviously key to landing a job. The art and science of creating great answers involves being strategic in crafting your responses as well as practicing till you’re as strong a possible. The best job candidates are not lucky. They spend a ton of time both on preparation because they know how important that 30-60 minute interview can be to their entire career. If you’d prefer to get started with a free resource before paying for a coach or a program, this tutorial is designed to get you up and running with the basics for acing your next interview (in ten easy lessons).
* [HOW TO ANSWER: Tell Me About Yourself](https://biginterview.com/blog/2011/09/tell-me-about-yourself.html) (Sep, 2011) - There are some job interview questions that are guaranteed to come up in most (if not all) of your job interviews — regardless of your industry, your experience level, and job type. At the top of this list is the universal and much-dreaded classic: “Tell me about yourself.” This question (or a variation like “Walk me through your background”) comes up in just about every job interview and many job searchers hate it. This question is an opportunity — an opening for you to set the tone of the job interview and emphasize the points that you most want this potential employer to know about you.
* [Answering Behavioral Interview Questions: Your Greatest Accomplishments](https://biginterview.com/blog/2017/04/greatest-accomplishment-question.html) - If your interviewer asks you this question, consider yourself lucky. It’s the perfect opportunity to talk about your most impressive experience. Unfortunately, most candidates waste this wonderful opportunity because they aren’t prepared and/or don’t feel comfortable “bragging.”


## Java Interview Questions

* [Top 10 Tricky Java interview questions and Answers](http://www.java67.com/2012/09/top-10-tricky-java-interview-questions-answers.html) (Sep, 2012) - What is a tricky question? Well, tricky Java interview questions are those questions which have some surprise element on it. If you try to answer a tricky question with common sense, you will most likely fail because they require some specific knowledge. Most of the tricky Java questions comes from confusing concepts like function overloading and overriding, Multi-threading which is really tricky to master, character encoding, checked vs unchecked exceptions and subtle Java programming details like Integer overflow. Most important thing to answer a tricky Java question is attitude and analytical thinking, which helps even if you don't know the answer. Anyway in this Java article we will see 10 Java questions which are real tricky and requires more than average knowledge of Java programming language to answer them correctly. As per my experience, there is always one or two tricky or tough Java interview question on any core Java or J2EE interviews, so it's good to prepare tricky questions from Java in advance.
* [Clean and SOLID Java EE code in practice](http://www.codebulb.ch/2015/06/clean-and-solid-java-ee-code-in-practice-part-1.html) (Jun 14, 2015) - Writing software to deliver functionality is not enough in the real world. Software has to be maintainable right after its initial programming, and typically for many years after its release. Luckily, there are some well-established design patterns and best practices which help us achieve high software quality. Rather than publishing another article about how things are done in the perfect world, I will here present some real-world examples of violated or misinterpreted design patterns I found throughout my career – and how to fix them.

They tend to test gently, subconsciously knowing where the code will break and avoiding the weak spots. Pragmatic Programmers are different. We are driven to find our bugs now, so we don’t have to endure the shame of others finding our bugs later.
* [Command Line Flags for the JVM](https://10kloc.wordpress.com/2013/05/10/command-line-options-in-java-virtual-machine/) (May 10, 2013) - This post attempts to demystify command-line options of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). I’m talking about those strange characters you often have to type when starting Java to run a program. The options are often used to specify environment variables (class path), configure  performance characteristics of the JVM (garbage collection frequency), amongst many other things.
* [Things every Java developer must know about Exception handling](https://10kloc.wordpress.com/2013/03/09/runtimeexceptions-try-catch-or-not-to-catch/) (Mar 9, 2013) - Exceptions are one of the most misunderstood (and misused) features of the Java programming language.

Inheritance, however has its own place in programming, and often times is a necessary evil. In this post, we explored Abstract Interfaces which combine the power of Interfaces with Inheritance. Abstract Interface is a term for Abstract Class, which implements all the functionality of an Interface. Abstract Interfaces always go with the Interfaces they are supporting.

## Java versions cronology
* [The Java Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_\(programming_language\)) - Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[14] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
* [Java Platform, Standard Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Standard_Edition) - Java Platform, Standard Edition or Java SE is a widely used computing platform for development and deployment of portable code for desktop and server environments. Java SE was formerly known as Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition or J2SE.
* [Java version history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history) - The Java language has undergone several changes since JDK 1.0 as well as numerous additions of classes and packages to the standard library. In addition to the language changes, much more dramatic changes have been made to the Java Class Library over the years, which has grown from a few hundred classes in JDK 1.0 to over three thousand in J2SE 5. Entire new APIs, such as Swing and Java2D, have been introduced, and many of the original JDK 1.0 classes and methods have been deprecated. 
* [Java Platform, Enterprise Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Enterprise_Edition) - Java Platform, Enterprise Edition or Java EE is a widely used computing platform for development and deployment of enterprise software (network and web services).[1] Java EE was formerly known as Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition or J2EE. The platform uses the object-oriented Java programming language. It is part of the Java software-platform family. Java EE extends the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE),[2] providing an API for object-relational mapping, distributed and multitier architectures, and web services. The platform incorporates a design based largely on modular components running on an application server. The platform emphasizes convention over configuration[3] and annotations for configuration. Optionally XML can be used to override annotations or to deviate from the platform defaults.
* [Java EE version history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_EE_version_history) - The Java Platform, Enterprise Edition or Java EE (formerly known as Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition or J2EE) has undergone several changes since 1.0 as well as numerous additions of new specifications.
