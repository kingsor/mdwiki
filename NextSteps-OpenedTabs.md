## Spark Framework
* [Spark Documentation](http://sparkjava.com/documentation) - Documentation here is always for the latest version of Spark. We don’t have the capacity to maintain separate docs for each version, but Spark is always backwards compatible.

Create API as a POJO. Start Spark in @BeforeClass, stop it in @AfterClass, make simple HTTP calls.
* [Creating a library website with login and multiple languages](http://sparkjava.com/tutorials/application-structure) (Jun 10, 2016) - You will learn how to create a basic Spark application with filters, controllers, views, authentication, localization, error handling, and more, but this is not really a full blown tutorial, it’s more a description of a basic structure, with certain points of the code highlighted.
* [Spark with MongoDB and Thinbus SRP Auth](http://sparkjava.com/tutorials/cloud-contact-app) (Nov 1, 2016) - Cloud contact is a platform that allows you to save your contacts in the cloud. So that you can access them from anywhere through a mobile phone or desktop or even from a cafe.

As mentioned in the disclaimer, Spark is a micro web framework for Java inspired by the Ruby framework Sinatra. Spark aims for simplicity and provides only a minimal set of features. However, it provides everything needed to build a web application in a few lines of Java code.
* [Deploying Spark on Heroku](http://sparkjava.com/tutorials/heroku) (Aug 24, 2015) - something usefull about the topic is in this post, but I had to integrate it with [Deploying Java Apps on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-java).
* [How Heroku Works](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/how-heroku-works) - This is a high-level, technical description of how Heroku works. It ties together many of the concepts you’ll encounter while writing, configuring, deploying and running applications on the Heroku platform.
* [Building APIs on the JVM Using Kotlin and Spark](https://nordicapis.com/building-apis-on-the-jvm-using-kotlin-and-spark-part-1/) (May 20, 2016) - In this two-part blog series, we’ll explain why the JVM provides a strong basis on which to run your APIs, and how to simplify their construction using a framework called Spark and a new programming language called Kotlin. In this first part, we will introduce you to the JVM and how it can execute code written in many programming languages, including Kotlin. We’ll discuss a number of Kotlin’s features and show them in the context of APIs. In our [second post](https://nordicapis.com/building-apis-on-the-jvm-using-kotlin-and-spark-part-2/), we explore the Spark framework in detail, and how to complement this toolkit with additional components like Inversion of Control (IoC). During the series, we’ll develop a boilerplate that you can use to create robust APIs with Kotlin and Spark. The code can be found on Github, so refer to it there as you read through the snippets below.
* [Why Kotlin is my next programming language](https://medium.com/@octskyward/why-kotlin-is-my-next-programming-language-c25c001e26e3) (Jul 7, 2015) - Kotlin is a new programming language from JetBrains, the maker of the world’s best IDEs. After much searching, I have settled on it as the programming language I will probably use for the next 5–10 years or so. I like Kotlin a lot and think it will be a very successful project. Someone who saw me using it in my open source work asked me to write about it, so in this article I’ll explain why I think Kotlin is good. Then I will discuss some of the problems and hiccups you may encounter if you start using it today. Finally, I’ll argue that now Kotlin is on the scene you should consider using the JVM if you aren’t already (e.g. because you use Go or Node).


## Testing
* [Testing APIs With Postman](https://www.ricston.com/blog/testing-apis-postman/) (Oct 17, 2016) - Postman gives you the possibility to share your collection for testing APIs through the cloud allowing easy collaboration among all team members. A very common scenario while testing APIs is the infrastructure might be present on your local machine, a staging setup, and a production setup. For this purpose, you can set different environments to switch contexts.


## MongoDB
* [Morphia](https://mongodb.github.io/morphia/) - The Java Object Document Mapper for MongoDB
* [Morphia Documentation](http://mongodb.github.io/morphia/1.3/) (version 1.3) - Morphia is built upon the MongoDB Java Driver. For reference documentation please see the driver documentation.

* [Microservices, Monoliths, and Modularity](https://genehughson.wordpress.com/2017/03/31/microservices-monoliths-and-modularity/) (Mar 31, 2017) - There are very valid reasons for considering a microservice architecture (MSA) when building/evolving an application. In my opinion, however, forcing modularity isn’t one of those very valid reasons.
* [The evolution of scalable microservices](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-evolution-of-scalable-microservices) (Jun 15, 2017) - In this article, we will look at microservices, not as a tool to scale the organization, development and release process (even though it's one of the main reasons for adopting microservices), but from an architecture and design perspective, and put it in its true context: distributed systems. In particular, we will discuss how to leverage Events-first Domain Driven Design and Reactive principles to build scalable microservices, working our way through the evolution of a scalable microservices-based system.


## Java

## ORMs
* [What ORMs have taught me: just learn SQL](http://woz.posthaven.com/what-orms-have-taught-me-just-learn-sql) - I've come to the conclusion that, for me, ORMs are more detriment than benefit. In short, they can be used to nicely augment working with SQL in a program, but they should not replace it.
