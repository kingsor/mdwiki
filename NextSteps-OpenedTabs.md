## ASP.NET Experiments
* [Getting Started with Entity Framework 6 Code First using MVC 5](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-ef-using-mvc/creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application) (Oct 22, 2015) - The Contoso University sample web application demonstrates how to create ASP.NET MVC 5 applications using the Entity Framework 6 and Visual Studio 2013. This tutorial uses the Code First workflow. For information about how to choose between Code First, Database First, and Model First, see [Entity Framework Development Workflows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178359.aspx#dbfmfcf). The sample application is a web site for a fictional Contoso University. It includes functionality such as student admission, course creation, and instructor assignments. This tutorial series explains how to build the Contoso University sample application. You can [download the completed application](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ASPNET-MVC-Application-b01a9fe8). A newer version of this tutorial series is available: [Get started with ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core using Visual Studio 2015](https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/data/ef-mvc/intro.html).
* [Building ASP.NET Web API RESTful Service – Part 1](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/687646/Building-ASP-NET-Web-API-RESTful-Service-Part-1) (Dec 16, 2013) - We'll be using Entity Framework Code First approach where we’ll define our model objects using Plain Old CLR Objects POCO. We’ll be code centeric and start by writing standard .NET classes which define the domain model objects that are suitable for our API. Those POCO classes will be responsible to generate our eLearning database. The eLearning database is simple, we want to be able to define and store Students and Tutors. As well, we have to define and store Courses and Subjects. We need to allow each Student to enroll in different Courses.


## Async/Await in C#
* [How would I run an async Task<T> method synchronously?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39371523/2768802) - I'm learning about async/await, and ran into a situation where I need to call an async method synchronously. How can I do that?
* [Don't Block on Async Code](http://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/07/dont-block-on-async-code.html) (Jul 12, 2012) - This is a problem that is brought up repeatedly on the forums and Stack Overflow. I think it’s the most-asked question by async newcomers once they’ve learned the basics.
* [Async and Await](http://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/02/async-and-await.html) (Feb 2, 2012) - Most people have already heard about the new “async” and “await” functionality coming in Visual Studio 11. This is Yet Another Introductory Post. First, the punchline: Async will fundamentally change the way most code is written. Yup, I believe async/await will have a bigger impact than LINQ. Understanding async will be a basic necessity just a few short years from now.
* [Working with asynchronous methods in C#](http://gigi.nullneuron.net/gigilabs/working-with-asynchronous-methods-in-c/) (Oct 1, 2017) - In this article, we’ll go through various different scenarios in which async/await can be used.

## Spark Framework
* [Spark Documentation](http://sparkjava.com/documentation) - Documentation here is always for the latest version of Spark. We don’t have the capacity to maintain separate docs for each version, but Spark is always backwards compatible.
* [Architecting a Testable Web Service in Spark Framework](http://blog.javafortesters.com/2017/07/architecting-testable-web-service-in.html) (Jul 5, 2017) - TLDR; Architecting a Web Service using Spark Framework to support more Unit testing and allow the inclusion of HTTP @Test methods in the build without deploying the application. Create API as a POJO. Start Spark in @BeforeClass, stop it in @AfterClass, make simple HTTP calls.

However, it provides everything needed to build a web application in a few lines of Java code.
* [Deploying Spark on Heroku](http://sparkjava.com/tutorials/heroku) (Aug 24, 2015) - something usefull about the topic is in this post, but I had to integrate it with [Deploying Java Apps on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-java).


## Kotlin
* [Building APIs on the JVM Using Kotlin and Spark](https://nordicapis.com/building-apis-on-the-jvm-using-kotlin-and-spark-part-1/) (May 20, 2016) - In this two-part blog series, we’ll explain why the JVM provides a strong basis on which to run your APIs, and how to simplify their construction using a framework called Spark and a new programming language called Kotlin. In this first part, we will introduce you to the JVM and how it can execute code written in many programming languages, including Kotlin. We’ll discuss a number of Kotlin’s features and show them in the context of APIs. In our [second post](https://nordicapis.com/building-apis-on-the-jvm-using-kotlin-and-spark-part-2/), we explore the Spark framework in detail, and how to complement this toolkit with additional components like Inversion of Control (IoC). During the series, we’ll develop a boilerplate that you can use to create robust APIs with Kotlin and Spark. The code can be found on Github, so refer to it there as you read through the snippets below.
* [Why Kotlin is my next programming language](https://medium.com/@octskyward/why-kotlin-is-my-next-programming-language-c25c001e26e3) (Jul 7, 2015) - Kotlin is a new programming language from JetBrains, the maker of the world’s best IDEs. After much searching, I have settled on it as the programming language I will probably use for the next 5–10 years or so. I like Kotlin a lot and think it will be a very successful project. Someone who saw me using it in my open source work asked me to write about it, so in this article I’ll explain why I think Kotlin is good. Then I will discuss some of the problems and hiccups you may encounter if you start using it today. Finally, I’ll argue that now Kotlin is on the scene you should consider using the JVM if you aren’t already (e.g. because you use Go or Node).


## Testing
* [Testing APIs With Postman](https://www.ricston.com/blog/testing-apis-postman/) (Oct 17, 2016) - Postman gives you the possibility to share your collection for testing APIs through the cloud allowing easy collaboration among all team members. A very common scenario while testing APIs is the infrastructure might be present on your local machine, a staging setup, and a production setup. For this purpose, you can set different environments to switch contexts.

* [Microservices, Monoliths, and Modularity](https://genehughson.wordpress.com/2017/03/31/microservices-monoliths-and-modularity/) (Mar 31, 2017) - There are very valid reasons for considering a microservice architecture (MSA) when building/evolving an application. In my opinion, however, forcing modularity isn’t one of those very valid reasons.
* [The evolution of scalable microservices](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-evolution-of-scalable-microservices) (Jun 15, 2017) - In this article, we will look at microservices, not as a tool to scale the organization, development and release process (even though it's one of the main reasons for adopting microservices), but from an architecture and design perspective, and put it in its true context: distributed systems. In particular, we will discuss how to leverage Events-first Domain Driven Design and Reactive principles to build scalable microservices, working our way through the evolution of a scalable microservices-based system.
