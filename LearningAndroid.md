### Working with SQLite

* [Saving Data in SQL Databases](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/data-storage/databases.html)  
  This class assumes that you are familiar with SQL databases in general and helps you get started with SQLite databases on Android. The APIs you'll need to use a database on Android are available in the [android.database.sqlite](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/package-summary.html) package.
* [Simple SQLite Database Tutorial](http://hmkcode.com/android-simple-sqlite-database-tutorial/)  
   Here we will see how to use SQLite API to perform database common operations (one table in the database).
* [Android SQLite Database Tutorial](http://www.androidhive.info/2011/11/android-sqlite-database-tutorial/) <i class="icon-ok"></i>  
  SQLite is a very light weight database which comes with Android OS. In this tutorial I’ll be discussing how to write classes to handle all SQLite operations in the scenario when you have one table in the database.
* [Android SQLite Database with Multiple Tables](http://www.androidhive.info/2013/09/android-sqlite-database-with-multiple-tables/) <i class="icon-ok"></i>  
I explained here how to handle the SQLite database when it is having multiple tables.
* [Using a Pre-Populated SQLite Database in Android](http://blog.softeq.com/2012/12/using-pre-populated-sqlite-database-in.html)  
  Most Android code samples and manuals assume that a SQLite database is created at runtime. But what if we want to use an existing database—for instance, a database created and populated on a PC?
* [Correctly Managing your SQLite Database](http://www.androiddesignpatterns.com/2012/05/correctly-managing-your-sqlite-database.html)  
  Managing the database can be complicated when first starting out with Android development, especially to those who are just beginning to understand the **Activity** lifecycle. The easiest solution is to make your database instance a singleton instance across the entire application's lifecycle. This will ensure that no leaks occur, and will make your life a lot easier since it eliminates the possibility of forgetting to close your database as you code.
* [Concurrent Database Access](https://github.com/dmytrodanylyk/dmytrodanylyk/blob/gh-pages/articles/Concurrent%20Database%20Access.md)  
  Dmytro Danylyk wrotes small article which describe how to make access to your android database thread safe.
* [Exact Difference between “Content-Provider” and “SQLite Database”](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3350408/exact-difference-between-content-provider-and-sqlite-database)  
  Storing your data in a database is one good way to persist your data, but there's a caveat in Android - **databases created in Android are visible only to the application that created them**. That is to say, a SQLite database created on Android by one application is usable only by that application, not by other applications.  
So, **if you need to share data between applications, you need to use the content provider model** as recommended in Android.  
[Using and Implementing Content Providers in Android](http://www.devx.com/wireless/Article/41133) is an article that presents the basics of content providers and how you can implement one.


## Libraries

* [Swipeable-Cards](https://github.com/kikoso/Swipeable-Cards)  
  A native library providing a Tinder-like cards effect. A card can be constructed using an image and displayed with animation effects, dismiss-to-like and dismiss-to-unlike, and use different sorting mechanisms.
* [desCharts](https://github.com/bradipao/desCharts)  
  Android Charting Library - a tribute to [René Descartes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes), father of analytical geometry
* [SuperListview](https://github.com/dommerq/SuperListview/)  
  This library is making listview way more easy to use. No need to embed the listview in a framelayout to add the progressbar or the emptyview. It's all right here.
* [An android library to display your changelog](http://gmariotti.blogspot.it/2013/08/an-android-library-to-display-your.html)
* [NotificationListenerService and kitkat](http://gmariotti.blogspot.it/2013/11/notificationlistenerservice-and-kitkat.html)
* [HoloCircleSeekBar](https://github.com/JesusM/HoloCircleSeekBar)  
  A Circle SeekBar inspired by Android Holo ColorPicker designed by Marie Schweiz and developed by Lars Werkman.
* [SeekArc](https://github.com/TriggerTrap/SeekArc)  
  Essentially it’s a SeekBar that has been wrapped around a circle. It acts like a SeekBar and generally has the same settings. You can even add a Listener to it as you would with a SeekBar.

### ORMLite

* [OrmLite - Lightweight Object Relational Mapping (ORM) Java Package](http://ormlite.com/)  
  Object Relational Mapping Lite (ORM Lite) provides some simple, lightweight functionality for persisting Java objects to SQL databases while avoiding the complexity and overhead of more standard ORM packages.
* [ORMLite on GitHub](https://github.com/j256)

## Open Source Projects

### MyTracks

* [Repo on Google Projects Hosting](https://code.google.com/p/mytracks/)  
  We no longer update the open source version of My Tracks, and we will remove these sources after 1/1/15. 

### Open Source Android "App Store"

* [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)  
  F-Droid is a software repository (or "app store") for Android applications; it functions similarly to the Google Play store, but only contains free and open-source software. The apps can be browsed and installed from the F-Droid website or directly from the F-Droid client app (which is not available in the Google Play store, but can be installed by sideloading). The F-Droid client app will automatically update installed F-Droid apps. The website also offers the source code of all applications for download. F-Droid does not require users to register and flags applications that contain "anti-features" such as advertising, user tracking or dependence on non-free software. The software running the F-Droid server is free software, and allows anybody to set up their own Android app repository.

### Services

* [Android Service Tutorial](http://www.survivingwithandroid.com/2014/01/android-service-tutorial.html)  
  In this post, we want to talk about Android Service. This is a key component in developing Android app. Differently from Activity, Service in Android runs in background, they don’t have an interface and have a life-cycle very different from Activities. Using Service we can implement some background operation, for example we can suppose we want to load a web page from a remote server. Using a Service we can implement multitask in Android.
* [Offline Sync Queue (aka. Superbus)](http://touchlabblog.tumblr.com/post/33710233787/offline-sync-queue-aka-superbus)  
  The OSQ facilitates offline app operation and syncing. The concept is very simple. Commands are sent to a service-based queue, and are processed when possible. Generally this means, if you have network access, commands are processed immediately. If there’s no network, they’re queued for later.  
Offline sync tends to come in two basic flavors: state based (**SB**) and command based (**CB**).
