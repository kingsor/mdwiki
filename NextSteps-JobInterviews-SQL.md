## SQL
* [Fundamentals of Relational Database Design](http://r937.com/relational.html)
* [SQL and Relational Theory, 3rd Edition](http://it-ebooks.info/book/6450/) (2015) - SQL is full of difficulties and traps for the unwary. You can avoid them if you understand relational theory, but only if you know how to put that theory into practice. In this book, Chris Date explains relational theory in depth, and demonstrates through numerous examples and exercises how you can apply it to your use of SQL. This third edition has been revised, extended, and improved throughout. Topics whose treatment has been expanded include data types and domains, table comparisons, image relations, aggregate operators and summarization, view updating, and subqueries. A special feature of this edition is a new appendix on NoSQL and relational theory.
* [SQL Server T-SQL Recipes, 4th Edition](http://it-ebooks.info/book/6540/) (2015) - SQL Server T-SQL Recipes is an example-based guide to the Transact-SQL language that is at the core of SQL Server. This edition has been lightly updated for SQL Server 2014 and provides ready-to-implement solutions to common programming and database administration tasks. Learn to create databases, create in-memory tables and stored procedures, insert and update data, generate reports, secure your data, and more. Tasks and their solutions are broken down into a problem/solution format that is quick and easy to read so that you can get the job done fast when the pressure is on. Solutions in this book are divided into chapters by problem domain. Each chapter is a collection of solutions around a single facet of the language such as writing queries, managing indexes, error handling, and query performance. Each solution is presented code-first, giving you a working code example to copy from and implement immediately in your own environment. Following each example is an in-depth description of how and why the given solution works. Tradeoffs and alternative approaches are also discussed.
	* [AdventureWorks Databases â€“ 2012, 2008R2 and 2008](http://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/releases/view/93587) - This release consolidates AdventureWorks databases for SQL Server 2012, 2008R2 and 2008 versions to one page. Each zip file contains an mdf database file and ldf log file. This should make it easier to find and download AdventureWorks databases since all OLTP versions are on one page. There are no database schema changes.
